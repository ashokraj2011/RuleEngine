## TL;DR {#domain.rule-engine.tldr}
This domain covers the repository's rule-evaluation capability: the public API, the rule grammar, the evaluator semantics, and the contracts that define valid requests and responses. The core vocabulary is rules, groups, conditions, operators, and data paths. The most important invariants are that rules are JSON-driven, groups combine child rules, and operator-specific shapes must be respected. The domain is intentionally narrow and stateless, so changes here are mainly about evaluator semantics and API behavior.

## Domain purpose {#domain.rule-engine.purpose}
The domain is the rule-engine API itself. It turns an arbitrary JSON input object and a rule descriptor into a single boolean decision. This capability is exposed through a web endpoint and implemented by the service layer.

## Terminology {#domain.rule-engine.terms}
- `data`: the input object evaluated against the rule.
- `rule`: a JSON object or array describing the logic to evaluate.
- `group`: a composite rule such as `all`, `any`, or `not`.
- `condition`: a rule object with `field`, `op`, and optional `value`.
- `operator`: an enum value such as `eq`, `between`, `regex`, or `exists`.

## Business rules and invariants {#domain.rule-engine.rules}
The engine supports group rules and condition rules, and it treats top-level arrays as implicit `all` groups. Operators have explicit shape expectations: `between` and `in` need arrays, `regex` needs a string, and existence/null operators use the field path rather than the `value` field. Unsupported or malformed structures throw `IllegalArgumentException`.

## Owning components {#domain.rule-engine.components}
- `src/main/java/org/example/api/RuleEngineController.java` exposes the API.
- `src/main/java/org/example/api/dto/` contains the request/response contracts.
- `src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java` implements the evaluator and rule semantics.
- `src/main/java/org/example/rules/Operator.java` defines the supported operator vocabulary.

## Main workflows {#domain.rule-engine.workflows}
1. A client posts a JSON payload to `/api/v1/rule-engine/evaluate`.
2. The controller validates the request and passes it to the service.
3. The service evaluates groups and conditions recursively.
4. The controller returns a JSON object with one boolean result field.

## Data and state {#domain.rule-engine.data}
The domain uses map-like input data and JSON rule trees. The visible implementation does not persist state or maintain workflow history; it performs evaluation within a single request.

## External integrations {#domain.rule-engine.integrations}
No external integrations or persistence adapters are visible in the inspected source tree. The repository exposes the capability as a self-contained HTTP service.

## Tests {#domain.rule-engine.tests}
The visible tests cover the controller and core evaluator semantics. They are a good starting point for preserving behavior when changing rule grammar or operator semantics.

## Change risks {#domain.rule-engine.risks}
Changing one operator can affect both validation and evaluation behavior. Changing path resolution can subtly alter existing rules. Changes to the public contract can require updates to the README as well as the tests.

## Unknowns {#domain.rule-engine.unknowns}
The repository does not define a production deployment model, an auth boundary, or a richer domain model beyond the evaluator. These are unknowns for future expansion rather than current implementation details.
