# ANU-2018 — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability solves TODO and produces the measurable outcome TODO. [ANU-2018:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes TODO and explicitly excludes TODO. [ANU-2018:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST satisfy TODO under the stated conditions. [ANU-2018:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

TODO: Record dependencies, risks, assumptions, and decisions required.

# Human clarification checkpoint

The `requirements` phase uses clarification mode `required`.
Prioritize material uncertainty about: scope, acceptance criteria, dependencies, constraints, risks.

- This checkpoint is required. Pause for at least one human response before authoring.
- If the evidence appears complete, ask the user to confirm your concise interpretation of the intended outcome, boundaries, and acceptance criteria rather than silently continuing.
- Ask one concise batch of no more than 5 questions with the interactive `ask_user` tool.
- Derive every question only from the current Story’s pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, repository world model, or contradictions among them. Never reuse example questions or placeholder text from templates.
- Do not ask for information already established by pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, or the repository world model.
- Treat pinned evidence as fact. Label every hypothesis or proposed design explicitly; never convert it into an acceptance or specification decision without human confirmation.
- For each question, explain briefly why the answer changes the governed output. Offer a recommended/default choice when the evidence supports one.
- Do not infer an answer from generic knowledge. The user may explicitly answer “unknown” or defer a non-blocking decision.
- After the response, incorporate confirmed answers into the phase artifact as decisions. Keep explicitly deferred items in Open questions with their impact and owner.
- Record the accepted response batch with `singularity-flow clarification record requirements --response-file <json>`. The record is bound to this exact prompt and prospective generation.
- A material unresolved decision remains blocking through specification publication; do not hide it behind a recommendation or placeholder.
- If `ask_user` is unavailable, print the numbered questions and stop before authoring or publication. Never turn missing interactivity into silent assumptions.
- Do not author or publish the governed output until the checkpoint is complete.

# Product owner agent

Search only within the working repository; governed artifacts are under singularity/work-items/<WORK-ID>/.

Use pinned business sources, the repository business view, and approved upstream artifacts as evidence. State the user, problem, outcome, scope, exclusions, dependencies, assumptions, and measurable success criteria. Convert evidence into stable `REQ-nnn` requirements and testable `AC-nnn` acceptance criteria with exact citations. Separate confirmed needs, proposals, and unresolved questions. Do not invent business intent or grant approval.

When the active phase prompt contains a Human clarification checkpoint, use `ask_user` and wait before authoring. A required checkpoint always pauses; if the evidence appears complete, ask the contributor to confirm the interpreted outcome, boundaries, and acceptance criteria. Record the accepted batch with `singularity-flow clarification record <phase> --response-file <json>`. Do not silently replace interactive clarification with an Open questions section.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

The rule engine needs a new operator that can compute the area of a circle from a radius input and return the calculated area as a value for downstream rule evaluation. The intended outcome is to make this capability available in the existing rule language so users can express calculations directly inside rules without introducing an external workaround.

## Proposed capability

Add support for a new value-producing operator in the rule engine that accepts a numeric radius input and returns the circle area calculation result. The capability should fit the current operator model used by the rule engine and be usable from the existing evaluation flow.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

Scope includes implementing the new operator, adding coverage for its behavior, and updating user-facing documentation so the capability is discoverable. The implementation should use a single radius field input contract and remain consistent with the repository’s existing rule engine conventions.

Constraints include staying within the current rule engine architecture and avoiding assumptions about unsupported input formats. Stakeholders include the rule engine maintainers, the API users who rely on expression-based evaluation, and the project team responsible for validating behavior through tests and documentation.

## Clarified decisions

- The feature will be a value-producing operator rather than a boolean condition operator.
- The operator will accept a single radius field input.
- The acceptance criteria should cover implementation, tests, and documentation.

## Open questions

- None at intake; the clarified decisions above define the current scope.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

The rule engine needs a new operator that can compute the area of a circle from a radius input and return the calculated area as a value for downstream rule evaluation. The intended outcome is to make this capability available in the existing rule language so users can express calculations directly inside rules without introducing an external workaround.

## Proposed capability

Add support for a new value-producing operator in the rule engine that accepts a numeric radius input and returns the circle area calculation result. The capability should fit the current operator model used by the rule engine and be usable from the existing evaluation flow.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

Scope includes implementing the new operator, adding coverage for its behavior, and updating user-facing documentation so the capability is discoverable. The implementation should use a single radius field input contract and remain consistent with the repository’s existing rule engine conventions.

Constraints include staying within the current rule engine architecture and avoiding assumptions about unsupported input formats. Stakeholders include the rule engine maintainers, the API users who rely on expression-based evaluation, and the project team responsible for validating behavior through tests and documentation.

## Clarified decisions

- The feature will be a value-producing operator rather than a boolean condition operator.
- The operator will accept a single radius field input.
- The acceptance criteria should cover implementation, tests, and documentation.

## Open questions

- None at intake; the clarified decisions above define the current scope.
