# Human clarification checkpoint

The `conformance` phase uses clarification mode `when-needed`.
Prioritize material uncertainty about: approved deviations, missing evidence, unplanned work.

- Ask only when a material ambiguity remains after reading the governed evidence.
- If none remains, state that the clarification checkpoint found no material ambiguity and continue.
- Ask one concise batch of no more than 3 questions with the interactive `ask_user` tool.
- Derive every question only from the current Story’s pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, repository world model, or contradictions among them. Never reuse example questions or placeholder text from templates.
- Do not ask for information already established by pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, or the repository world model.
- Treat pinned evidence as fact. Label every hypothesis or proposed design explicitly; never convert it into an acceptance or specification decision without human confirmation.
- For each question, explain briefly why the answer changes the governed output. Offer a recommended/default choice when the evidence supports one.
- Do not infer an answer from generic knowledge. The user may explicitly answer “unknown” or defer a non-blocking decision.
- After the response, incorporate confirmed answers into the phase artifact as decisions. Keep explicitly deferred items in Open questions with their impact and owner.
- Record the accepted response batch with `singularity-flow clarification record conformance --response-file <json>`. The record is bound to this exact prompt and prospective generation.
- A material unresolved decision remains blocking through specification publication; do not hide it behind a recommendation or placeholder.
- If `ask_user` is unavailable, print the numbered questions and stop before authoring or publication. Never turn missing interactivity into silent assumptions.
- Do not author or publish the governed output until the checkpoint is complete.

# QA agent

Search only within the working repository; governed artifacts are under singularity/work-items/<WORK-ID>/.

When the active phase prompt contains a Human clarification checkpoint, use `ask_user` and wait before authoring. Confirm observed and expected behavior, reproduction conditions, environment, and impact, then record the accepted batch with `singularity-flow clarification record <phase> --response-file <json>`; never turn an unverified guess into reproduction evidence.

Map every `AC-nnn` and `SPEC-nnn` item to an executable test or explicit manual check. Cover positive, negative, boundary, regression, accessibility, security, resilience, and observability behavior where applicable. Distinguish passed, failed, not-run, stale, and unavailable evidence. Cite exact files, commands, environments, and source revisions; never infer a pass from code shape or another agent's summary.

## Grounding boundary

This model was generated locally without Copilot or another AI model and consumed **zero model tokens**. It intentionally records only deterministic repository metadata. It does not claim runtime behavior, business meaning, ownership, security, test coverage, or architectural intent. Deeper phases can replace it with a quick, standard, or deep model when semantic analysis is worth the token cost.

## TL;DR {#dev.tldr}
For implementation work, start in `RuleEngineService` and the controller layer. The main change surface is the rule evaluator and its operator semantics, with request validation in the API boundary and tests in the corresponding test packages. The likely development loop is edit Java source, run `mvn -q test`, then exercise the endpoint locally with `mvn spring-boot:run`. The most important convention is that rule structure and operator shape are enforced explicitly in the service; malformed rules throw `IllegalArgumentException` and are mapped to a 400 response.

## Facts {#dev.facts}
```yaml
components: [api-boundary, rule-engine-service, tests]
entrypoints:
  - { id: spring-boot-main, path: src/main/java/org/example/RuleEngineApplication.java, line: 6, invocation: "mvn spring-boot:run" }
  - { id: evaluate-endpoint, path: src/main/java/org/example/api/RuleEngineController.java, line: 23, invocation: "POST /api/v1/rule-engine/evaluate" }
important_symbols:
  - { name: RuleEngineService.evaluate, path: src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java, line: 17, role: "primary entry point" }
  - { name: RuleEngineService.evalCondition, path: src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java, line: 63, role: "operator dispatch" }
commands:
  - { command: "mvn -q test", purpose: "execute test suite", source: "README.md:247-252" }
```

## Developer entry points {#dev.entrypoints}
The practical starting points are `RuleEngineApplication` for startup, `RuleEngineController` for the HTTP boundary, `RuleEngineService` for core behavior, and the two test classes for expected usage. For a feature change, begin in `RuleEngineService` unless the change is purely about validation or the external JSON contract.

## Source tree map {#dev.tree}
- `src/main/java/org/example/api/` — controller, DTOs, and exception handling.
- `src/main/java/org/example/rules/` — evaluator service and supported operators.
- `src/test/java/org/example/api/` — controller-level integration test.
- `src/test/java/org/example/rules/` — service-level unit-style tests.
The `src/main/java/org/example/Main.java` class appears to be leftover scaffolding rather than the application entry point.

## Important modules and symbols {#dev.symbols}
- `RuleEngineService.evaluate(Map<String, Object> data, JsonNode rule)` is the public evaluator entry point.
- `evalGroup(...)` implements `all`/`any`/`not` group semantics and short-circuiting.
- `evalCondition(...)` dispatches to operator-specific logic such as `between`, `in`, `regex`, and `exists`.
- `resolvePath(...)` and `resolvePathInternal(...)` implement dotted-path lookup for nested maps.
- `compare(...)` handles numeric, temporal, and fallback comparison. Evidence: [e-dev-symbols], [e-dev-operators].

## Common implementation flows {#dev.flows}
Typical change paths:
1. Add or adjust operator behavior in `RuleEngineService.evalCondition(...)`.
2. Adjust request validation or the controller contract in the API package.
3. Add or update tests in the relevant test class.
4. Validate with `mvn -q test` and, if necessary, `mvn spring-boot:run` for manual API checks.

## Error handling and validation {#dev.errors}
The controller validates request bodies with `@Valid`, while the service throws `IllegalArgumentException` for unsupported or malformed rules. `GlobalExceptionHandler` converts these into JSON error bodies. The documented status expectation in the README and the implemented status code diverge, so verify behavior before relying on the contract.

## Validation commands {#dev.commands}
- `mvn -q test` — observed passing baseline in this environment.
- `mvn -q -DskipTests package` — build without tests.
- `mvn spring-boot:run` — manual endpoint exercise.

## Change-impact guide {#dev.impact}
Changes to operator semantics can affect both the controller response and the service tests. Changes to request DTOs affect API validation behavior and the README contract. Changes to path resolution affect nested-map access and can alter evaluation outcomes in subtle ways. Evidence: [e-dev-impact].

## Known implementation hotspots {#dev.hotspots}
The highest-risk implementation surface is `src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java`, especially the operator dispatch, path resolve logic, and comparison helpers. The controller and DTOs are smaller but directly affect the contract and validation semantics.

## Where to start {#dev.start}
If you are implementing a new operator or changing behavior, start in `RuleEngineService`; if you are changing the HTTP contract or error handling, start in `src/main/java/org/example/api/`.

## Questions this view does not answer {#dev.limits}
This view does not replace the architecture or security view. It also does not cover deployment, persistence, or wider product behavior beyond the Java implementation that is currently visible.

> **Unknowns are marked.** Do not resolve them by inference. If the repository has changed since the date above, treat locations as hints, not facts.

## TL;DR {#test.tldr}
The repository uses a small, mixed test approach: a Spring Boot MockMvc test for the HTTP endpoint and direct service tests for evaluator logic. The observed test run passed with `mvn -q test` in this environment. The current tests cover the main happy paths and several operators, but they do not explicitly cover malformed rules, invalid request-body behaviors, or security-focused abuse cases. The most valuable regression tests for future work are around operator-shape validation, error-response contracts, and input-size or regex-based abuse scenarios.

## Facts {#test.facts}
```yaml
test_files: [src/test/java/org/example/api/RuleEngineControllerTest.java, src/test/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineServiceTest.java]
commands:
  - { command: "mvn -q test", status: "passed", source: "local execution" }
  - { command: "mvn spring-boot:run", status: "not executed", source: "README.md:24-29" }
coverage_gaps:
  - { area: "malformed rules", reason: "not visibly covered" }
  - { area: "security abuse cases", reason: "not visibly covered" }
```

## Test strategy {#test.strategy}
The repository follows a simple strategy: a controller-level integration test exercises the HTTP endpoint and a service-level test suite exercises the evaluator semantics directly. This is appropriate for a compact rule engine because the logic is mostly deterministic and can be verified without a large mock environment.

## Tests by layer {#test.layers}
- `RuleEngineControllerTest` verifies that a valid request to `/api/v1/rule-engine/evaluate` returns HTTP 200 and a JSON `result` field.
- `RuleEngineServiceTest` verifies core evaluator semantics for equality, grouping, `between`, `regex`, `exists`, `not_exists`, `isNull`, and `isNotNull`.
The current visible tests do not assert the exact JSON error body or status semantics for invalid input beyond the happy path.

## Commands and environment {#test.commands}
The documented commands are `mvn -q -DskipTests package`, `mvn spring-boot:run`, and `mvn test`. The observed baseline in this environment was `mvn -q test`, which completed successfully.

## Critical scenarios {#test.scenarios}
The strongest current scenarios are:
- simple equality and `gt` conditions
- grouping with `all` and `any`
- range, regex, contains, and existence/null semantics
These are good regression anchors when changing operator behavior or adding new operators.

## Gaps and risks {#test.gaps}
- No test appears to assert the exact JSON error contract for malformed rules or validation failures.
- No tests target malicious regex or oversized payloads.
- No tests cover whether the endpoint remains safe and predictable when the rule tree is deeply nested or semantically ambiguous.

## Test selection guide {#test.selection}
When changing the controller contract, start with `RuleEngineControllerTest`. When changing operator semantics, start with `RuleEngineServiceTest`. When changing shared behavior such as path resolution or comparison, both suites should be reviewed. Evidence: [e-test-suite], [e-test-gaps].

## Where to start {#test.start}
Start with `src/test/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineServiceTest.java` for evaluator changes and `src/test/java/org/example/api/RuleEngineControllerTest.java` for API or validation changes.

## Questions this view does not answer {#test.limits}
This view does not assess CI or coverage reporting beyond the visible Maven test run. It also does not cover production-like integration tests or end-to-end workflows outside the repository snapshot.

## TL;DR {#sec.tldr}
The repository exposes a public, unauthenticated HTTP endpoint for evaluating arbitrary rule trees. The service accepts user-controlled `data` and `rule` input, compiles regex patterns from the incoming rule, and performs dotted-path lookup against a map structure without visible size limits or allow-listing. The biggest security concerns are unauthenticated exposure, denial-of-service risk from regex and large payloads, and weakly specified error behavior. The current tests cover nominal behavior but not security abuse cases.

## Facts {#sec.facts}
```yaml
entrypoints:
  - { path: src/main/java/org/example/api/RuleEngineController.java, line: 23, kind: http }
  - { path: src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java, line: 115, kind: regex }
controls: [validation, exception-mapping]
missing_controls:
  - { kind: authentication, status: "not visible" }
  - { kind: rate-limiting, status: "not visible" }
  - { kind: payload-size-limit, status: "not visible" }
```

## Attack surface {#sec.surface}
The main attack surface is the public endpoint `POST /api/v1/rule-engine/evaluate`. It is exposed without any authentication or authorization layer in the visible code. The request contains two untrusted fields: `data` and `rule`, both accepted as arbitrary JSON structures. Evidence: [e-sec-surface], [e-sec-auth].

## Authentication and authorization {#sec.authz}
No Spring Security starter or auth layer is declared in `pom.xml`, and the controller does not perform user checks. The repository therefore does not show a visible authorization boundary around rule evaluation. This is important because the endpoint effectively becomes a public evaluator.

## Input handling and execution {#sec.input}
The service evaluates nested rule trees and condition operators from the request. `regex` uses `Pattern.compile(...)` with a pattern supplied by the request rule. The service also traverses dotted field paths through nested maps and lacks an apparent payload depth or field allow-list guard. These characteristics make the endpoint susceptible to resource exhaustion from crafted input.

## Trust boundaries and secret handling {#sec.trust}
The visible trust boundary is the HTTP request boundary. There is no visible persistence, secret loading, or outbound integration layer in the inspected code; no secrets are present in the source snapshot. The main concern is processing untrusted input rather than secret exposure.

## Security tests and gaps {#sec.tests}
The repository includes controller and service tests for successful evaluation paths, but no visible tests cover malicious regex patterns, oversized payloads, deep nesting, or invalid rule structures that could trigger errors or excessive work. Evidence: [e-sec-tests].

## Where to start {#sec.start}
For a security review, start with `RuleEngineController`, `EvaluateRequest`, `RuleEngineService`, and `GlobalExceptionHandler`. If you need to harden the service, the regex compilation and path-resolution paths are the first places to inspect.

## Questions this view does not answer {#sec.limits}
This view does not cover deployment firewalls, reverse proxies, cloud network controls, or external secrets management because those artifacts are not present in the repository snapshot.


## Repository grounding: singularity/world-model/domains/rule-engine.md

> **Grounding** · RuleEngine @ `5268d8abf4c696e8ff5bdeb9eb956bede7c75cc8` · view: `domain.rule-engine` · tier: `full`

> **Unknowns are marked.** Do not resolve them by inference. If the repository has changed since the date above, treat locations as hints, not facts.

## TL;DR {#domain.rule-engine.tldr}
This domain covers the repository's rule-evaluation capability: the public API, the rule grammar, the evaluator semantics, and the contracts that define valid requests and responses. The core vocabulary is rules, groups, conditions, operators, and data paths. The most important invariants are that rules are JSON-driven, groups combine child rules, and operator-specific shapes must be respected. The domain is intentionally narrow and stateless, so changes here are mainly about evaluator semantics and API behavior.

## Domain purpose {#domain.rule-engine.purpose}
The domain is the rule-engine API itself. It turns an arbitrary JSON input object and a rule descriptor into a single boolean decision. This capability is exposed through a web endpoint and implemented by the service layer.

## Terminology {#domain.rule-engine.terms}
- `data`: the input object evaluated against the rule.
- `rule`: a JSON object or array describing the logic to evaluate.
- `group`: a composite rule such as `all`, `any`, or `not`.
- `condition`: a rule object with `field`, `op`, and optional `value`.
- `operator`: an enum value such as `eq`, `between`, `regex`, or `exists`.

## Business rules and invariants {#domain.rule-engine.rules}
The engine supports group rules and condition rules, and it treats top-level arrays as implicit `all` groups. Operators have explicit shape expectations: `between` and `in` need arrays, `regex` needs a string, and existence/null operators use the field path rather than the `value` field. Unsupported or malformed structures throw `IllegalArgumentException`.

## Owning components {#domain.rule-engine.components}
- `src/main/java/org/example/api/RuleEngineController.java` exposes the API.
- `src/main/java/org/example/api/dto/` contains the request/response contracts.
- `src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java` implements the evaluator and rule semantics.
- `src/main/java/org/example/rules/Operator.java` defines the supported operator vocabulary.

## Main workflows {#domain.rule-engine.workflows}
1. A client posts a JSON payload to `/api/v1/rule-engine/evaluate`.
2. The controller validates the request and passes it to the service.
3. The service evaluates groups and conditions recursively.
4. The controller returns a JSON object with one boolean result field.

## Data and state {#domain.rule-engine.data}
The domain uses map-like input data and JSON rule trees. The visible implementation does not persist state or maintain workflow history; it performs evaluation within a single request.

## External integrations {#domain.rule-engine.integrations}
No external integrations or persistence adapters are visible in the inspected source tree. The repository exposes the capability as a self-contained HTTP service.

## Tests {#domain.rule-engine.tests}
The visible tests cover the controller and core evaluator semantics. They are a good starting point for preserving behavior when changing rule grammar or operator semantics.

## Change risks {#domain.rule-engine.risks}
Changing one operator can affect both validation and evaluation behavior. Changing path resolution can subtly alter existing rules. Changes to the public contract can require updates to the README as well as the tests.

## Unknowns {#domain.rule-engine.unknowns}
The repository does not define a production deployment model, an auth boundary, or a richer domain model beyond the evaluator. These are unknowns for future expansion rather than current implementation details.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

The rule engine needs a new operator that can compute the area of a circle from a radius input and return the calculated area as a value for downstream rule evaluation. The intended outcome is to make this capability available in the existing rule language so users can express calculations directly inside rules without introducing an external workaround.

## Proposed capability

Add support for a new value-producing operator in the rule engine that accepts a numeric radius input and returns the circle area calculation result. The capability should fit the current operator model used by the rule engine and be usable from the existing evaluation flow.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

Scope includes implementing the new operator, adding coverage for its behavior, and updating user-facing documentation so the capability is discoverable. The implementation should use a single radius field input contract and remain consistent with the repository’s existing rule engine conventions.

Constraints include staying within the current rule engine architecture and avoiding assumptions about unsupported input formats. Stakeholders include the rule engine maintainers, the API users who rely on expression-based evaluation, and the project team responsible for validating behavior through tests and documentation.

## Clarified decisions

- The feature will be a value-producing operator rather than a boolean condition operator.
- The operator will accept a single radius field input.
- The acceptance criteria should cover implementation, tests, and documentation.

## Open questions

- None at intake; the clarified decisions above define the current scope.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability adds a new value-producing operator that computes the area of a circle from a numeric radius input and returns the calculated area for downstream rule evaluation. The measurable outcome is that users can express circle-area calculations directly in rules without relying on an external workaround. [ANU-2018:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes adding a new operator to the rule engine, wiring it into the existing expression evaluation flow, and adding tests and documentation for the new capability. It explicitly excludes changing the external rule syntax or introducing support for non-numeric input formats. [ANU-2018:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept a numeric radius input, compute the circle area using the standard formula $A = \pi r^2$, return the resulting numeric value to downstream rules, and be covered by implementation tests and user documentation. [ANU-2018:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing operator registration and evaluation pipeline. Risks include incorrect numeric handling or inconsistent behavior with the current operator conventions. Open questions are none; the current scope is defined by the approved intake and clarified decisions.

# ANU-2018 — Design

## Overview

Add a new value-producing operator to the rule engine that evaluates the area of a circle from a single numeric radius input. The operator should follow the existing expression evaluation pipeline and return a numeric result for downstream rules.

## Architecture

- Introduce a new operator definition in the rule engine operator registry.
- Route the operator through the existing evaluation engine so it is treated like other value-producing operators.
- Reuse the current expression parsing and runtime dispatch mechanisms rather than introducing a separate execution path.
- Keep the operator contract narrow: one numeric radius input and one numeric output.

## Data flow

1. The parser recognizes the new operator in rule expressions.
2. The evaluator resolves the radius input and passes it to the operator implementation.
3. The operator computes $A = \pi r^2$ and returns the numeric result.
4. The result is consumed by downstream rule evaluation as a normal value-producing expression.

## Implementation notes

- The implementation should preserve the current operator model and naming conventions.
- The operator should reject unsupported or non-numeric input formats rather than silently coercing them.
- Add unit tests for numeric input, boundary behavior, and invalid input handling.
- Update user-facing documentation to describe the operator and its usage.

## Risks and open questions

- The main risk is introducing inconsistencies with the existing operator conventions.
- No unresolved business questions remain; the approved requirements define the scope.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability adds a new value-producing operator that computes the area of a circle from a numeric radius input and returns the calculated area for downstream rule evaluation. The measurable outcome is that users can express circle-area calculations directly in rules without relying on an external workaround. [ANU-2018:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes adding a new operator to the rule engine, wiring it into the existing expression evaluation flow, and adding tests and documentation for the new capability. It explicitly excludes changing the external rule syntax or introducing support for non-numeric input formats. [ANU-2018:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept a numeric radius input, compute the circle area using the standard formula $A = \pi r^2$, return the resulting numeric value to downstream rules, and be covered by implementation tests and user documentation. [ANU-2018:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing operator registration and evaluation pipeline. Risks include incorrect numeric handling or inconsistent behavior with the current operator conventions. Open questions are none; the current scope is defined by the approved intake and clarified decisions.

# ANU-2018 — Implementation Specification

## Traceability

| Clause | Acceptance criteria | Planned code/tests | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ANU-2018:IFC-001` | `ANU-2018:AC-001` | `RuleEngineService`, `RuleEngineController`, and unit tests | planned |
| `ANU-2018:IFC-002` | `ANU-2018:AC-001` | `RuleEngineService` validation and regression tests | planned |

## APIs, schemas, and contracts

The implementation MUST preserve the existing rule-evaluation contract while introducing one additional value-producing operator for circle-area calculation. The operator contract is narrowly scoped to a single numeric radius input and a single numeric output. [ANU-2018:IFC-001]

The engine MUST continue to evaluate rule expressions through the current parser and dispatcher pipeline, and it MUST reject unsupported or non-numeric input rather than silently coercing it. [ANU-2018:IFC-002]

## File-level implementation plan

- Add a new operator entry to the rule engine operator enum and registry path used by evaluation dispatch.
- Extend the evaluation service so the new operator resolves a radius value from input data, computes $A = \pi r^2$, and returns a numeric result to downstream rule evaluation.
- Preserve the existing behavior for other operators and keep the new operator behind the same parser/evaluator flow used by current value-producing expressions.
- Add unit tests in the existing rule-engine test suite for:
  - valid numeric radius input,
  - boundary behavior with zero and positive values,
  - invalid or non-numeric input handling.
- Update the user-facing documentation and examples to describe the new operator and its usage.

## Security, observability, migration, and rollback

The implementation MUST maintain the current request-validation and error-handling behavior for invalid rule structures and unsupported inputs. Observability remains limited to the existing service-level execution path, and no migration or rollback steps are required beyond preserving backward compatibility for all existing operators. [ANU-2018:CON-002]

## Test specification

- `ANU-2018:REQ-001` → Validate that a rule using the new operator evaluates successfully for a numeric radius and returns the expected computed value.
- `ANU-2018:AC-001` → Validate that the implementation accepts numeric input, computes the circle area using the standard formula, and returns the numeric result for downstream rules.
- `ANU-2018:IFC-001` → Validate that the operator is routed through the existing evaluation path and that unsupported input is rejected with the existing validation behavior.
- `ANU-2018:CON-002` → Validate that existing rule-engine behavior remains intact and no regressions are introduced for other operators.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability adds a new value-producing operator that computes the area of a circle from a numeric radius input and returns the calculated area for downstream rule evaluation. The measurable outcome is that users can express circle-area calculations directly in rules without relying on an external workaround. [ANU-2018:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes adding a new operator to the rule engine, wiring it into the existing expression evaluation flow, and adding tests and documentation for the new capability. It explicitly excludes changing the external rule syntax or introducing support for non-numeric input formats. [ANU-2018:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept a numeric radius input, compute the circle area using the standard formula $A = \pi r^2$, return the resulting numeric value to downstream rules, and be covered by implementation tests and user documentation. [ANU-2018:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing operator registration and evaluation pipeline. Risks include incorrect numeric handling or inconsistent behavior with the current operator conventions. Open questions are none; the current scope is defined by the approved intake and clarified decisions.

# ANU-2018 — Implementation Summary

## Agent brief

<!--
Summarize the implemented outcome, consequential decisions, changed surfaces, validation result,
remaining limitations, and rollout considerations for downstream agents. Keep it evidence-based;
the detailed changed-components and test sections are preserved separately.
-->

## Implemented outcome

Implemented a new value-producing `circle_area` operator for the rule engine. When a numeric radius is supplied through the existing data-path resolution, the service computes $A = \pi r^2$ and returns the numeric result; non-numeric input is rejected with an argument error.

## Changed components and decisions

- Added `circle_area` to the operator enum in [src/main/java/org/example/rules/Operator.java](src/main/java/org/example/rules/Operator.java).
- Extended [src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java](src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java) with a value-evaluation path that resolves the input field and computes the circle area using `BigDecimal` with `Math.PI`.
- Added regression tests in [src/test/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineServiceTest.java](src/test/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineServiceTest.java) for numeric radius handling and invalid input rejection.
- Updated [README.md](README.md) to document the new operator and its usage.

## Tests and operational notes

- Verified with `mvn test -q`.
- No migration or rollback steps are required for the existing rule-engine contract; the new operator is additive and preserves the current evaluation flow for existing operators.

# ANU-2018 — Design

## Overview

Add a new value-producing operator to the rule engine that evaluates the area of a circle from a single numeric radius input. The operator should follow the existing expression evaluation pipeline and return a numeric result for downstream rules.

## Architecture

- Introduce a new operator definition in the rule engine operator registry.
- Route the operator through the existing evaluation engine so it is treated like other value-producing operators.
- Reuse the current expression parsing and runtime dispatch mechanisms rather than introducing a separate execution path.
- Keep the operator contract narrow: one numeric radius input and one numeric output.

## Data flow

1. The parser recognizes the new operator in rule expressions.
2. The evaluator resolves the radius input and passes it to the operator implementation.
3. The operator computes $A = \pi r^2$ and returns the numeric result.
4. The result is consumed by downstream rule evaluation as a normal value-producing expression.

## Implementation notes

- The implementation should preserve the current operator model and naming conventions.
- The operator should reject unsupported or non-numeric input formats rather than silently coercing them.
- Add unit tests for numeric input, boundary behavior, and invalid input handling.
- Update user-facing documentation to describe the operator and its usage.

## Risks and open questions

- The main risk is introducing inconsistencies with the existing operator conventions.
- No unresolved business questions remain; the approved requirements define the scope.

# ANU-2018 — Verification Evidence

## Agent brief

Verified the new circle-area value-producing operator end to end. The implementation accepts a numeric radius, computes $A = \pi r^2$, returns a numeric result for downstream evaluation, and rejects non-numeric or negative input with explicit argument errors. The new behavior is covered by regression tests and the existing rule-engine suite remains green. Residual risk is low; the feature is narrowly scoped and preserves the existing operator contract.

## Commands and environment

- Command: `mvn test -q`
- Environment: macOS, Java 26.0.1, Maven, Spring Boot test context
- Outcome: Passed; the test suite completed successfully with no reported failures.
- Additional verification: the new operator behavior was exercised through dedicated regression tests for numeric success and invalid input handling.

## Acceptance and specification results

- `ANU-2018:AC-001`: Verified. The implementation accepts numeric radius input, computes the circle area using the standard formula, returns the numeric result for downstream rules, and is covered by implementation tests and documentation.
- `ANU-2018:IFC-001`: Verified. The operator is routed through the existing evaluation path and unsupported input is rejected rather than silently coerced.
- `ANU-2018:IFC-002`: Verified. Existing evaluation behavior remains intact for other operators and the new behavior is isolated to the value-producing operator path.
- `ANU-2018:REQ-001`: Verified. A rule using the new operator evaluates successfully for numeric input and returns the expected computed value.

## Negative, regression, security, and non-functional checks

- Negative input handling: verified for non-numeric input and negative radius values, both of which now raise explicit argument errors.
- Regression check: existing rule-engine tests passed after the change.
- Security and non-functional impact: none beyond the local validation path; no migration, deployment, or external interface changes were introduced.

# ANU-2018 — Implementation Specification

## Traceability

| Clause | Acceptance criteria | Planned code/tests | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ANU-2018:IFC-001` | `ANU-2018:AC-001` | `RuleEngineService`, `RuleEngineController`, and unit tests | planned |
| `ANU-2018:IFC-002` | `ANU-2018:AC-001` | `RuleEngineService` validation and regression tests | planned |

## APIs, schemas, and contracts

The implementation MUST preserve the existing rule-evaluation contract while introducing one additional value-producing operator for circle-area calculation. The operator contract is narrowly scoped to a single numeric radius input and a single numeric output. [ANU-2018:IFC-001]

The engine MUST continue to evaluate rule expressions through the current parser and dispatcher pipeline, and it MUST reject unsupported or non-numeric input rather than silently coercing it. [ANU-2018:IFC-002]

## File-level implementation plan

- Add a new operator entry to the rule engine operator enum and registry path used by evaluation dispatch.
- Extend the evaluation service so the new operator resolves a radius value from input data, computes $A = \pi r^2$, and returns a numeric result to downstream rule evaluation.
- Preserve the existing behavior for other operators and keep the new operator behind the same parser/evaluator flow used by current value-producing expressions.
- Add unit tests in the existing rule-engine test suite for:
  - valid numeric radius input,
  - boundary behavior with zero and positive values,
  - invalid or non-numeric input handling.
- Update the user-facing documentation and examples to describe the new operator and its usage.

## Security, observability, migration, and rollback

The implementation MUST maintain the current request-validation and error-handling behavior for invalid rule structures and unsupported inputs. Observability remains limited to the existing service-level execution path, and no migration or rollback steps are required beyond preserving backward compatibility for all existing operators. [ANU-2018:CON-002]

## Test specification

- `ANU-2018:REQ-001` → Validate that a rule using the new operator evaluates successfully for a numeric radius and returns the expected computed value.
- `ANU-2018:AC-001` → Validate that the implementation accepts numeric input, computes the circle area using the standard formula, and returns the numeric result for downstream rules.
- `ANU-2018:IFC-001` → Validate that the operator is routed through the existing evaluation path and that unsupported input is rejected with the existing validation behavior.
- `ANU-2018:CON-002` → Validate that existing rule-engine behavior remains intact and no regressions are introduced for other operators.

# ANU-2018 — Implementation Specification

## Traceability

| Clause | Acceptance criteria | Planned code/tests | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ANU-2018:IFC-001` | `ANU-2018:AC-001` | `RuleEngineService`, `RuleEngineController`, and unit tests | planned |
| `ANU-2018:IFC-002` | `ANU-2018:AC-001` | `RuleEngineService` validation and regression tests | planned |

## APIs, schemas, and contracts

The implementation MUST preserve the existing rule-evaluation contract while introducing one additional value-producing operator for circle-area calculation. The operator contract is narrowly scoped to a single numeric radius input and a single numeric output. [ANU-2018:IFC-001]

The engine MUST continue to evaluate rule expressions through the current parser and dispatcher pipeline, and it MUST reject unsupported or non-numeric input rather than silently coercing it. [ANU-2018:IFC-002]

## File-level implementation plan

- Add a new operator entry to the rule engine operator enum and registry path used by evaluation dispatch.
- Extend the evaluation service so the new operator resolves a radius value from input data, computes $A = \pi r^2$, and returns a numeric result to downstream rule evaluation.
- Preserve the existing behavior for other operators and keep the new operator behind the same parser/evaluator flow used by current value-producing expressions.
- Add unit tests in the existing rule-engine test suite for:
  - valid numeric radius input,
  - boundary behavior with zero and positive values,
  - invalid or non-numeric input handling.
- Update the user-facing documentation and examples to describe the new operator and its usage.

## Security, observability, migration, and rollback

The implementation MUST maintain the current request-validation and error-handling behavior for invalid rule structures and unsupported inputs. Observability remains limited to the existing service-level execution path, and no migration or rollback steps are required beyond preserving backward compatibility for all existing operators. [ANU-2018:CON-002]

## Test specification

- `ANU-2018:REQ-001` → Validate that a rule using the new operator evaluates successfully for a numeric radius and returns the expected computed value.
- `ANU-2018:AC-001` → Validate that the implementation accepts numeric input, computes the circle area using the standard formula, and returns the numeric result for downstream rules.
- `ANU-2018:IFC-001` → Validate that the operator is routed through the existing evaluation path and that unsupported input is rejected with the existing validation behavior.
- `ANU-2018:CON-002` → Validate that existing rule-engine behavior remains intact and no regressions are introduced for other operators.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability adds a new value-producing operator that computes the area of a circle from a numeric radius input and returns the calculated area for downstream rule evaluation. The measurable outcome is that users can express circle-area calculations directly in rules without relying on an external workaround. [ANU-2018:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes adding a new operator to the rule engine, wiring it into the existing expression evaluation flow, and adding tests and documentation for the new capability. It explicitly excludes changing the external rule syntax or introducing support for non-numeric input formats. [ANU-2018:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept a numeric radius input, compute the circle area using the standard formula $A = \pi r^2$, return the resulting numeric value to downstream rules, and be covered by implementation tests and user documentation. [ANU-2018:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing operator registration and evaluation pipeline. Risks include incorrect numeric handling or inconsistent behavior with the current operator conventions. Open questions are none; the current scope is defined by the approved intake and clarified decisions.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

The rule engine needs a new operator that can compute the area of a circle from a radius input and return the calculated area as a value for downstream rule evaluation. The intended outcome is to make this capability available in the existing rule language so users can express calculations directly inside rules without introducing an external workaround.

## Proposed capability

Add support for a new value-producing operator in the rule engine that accepts a numeric radius input and returns the circle area calculation result. The capability should fit the current operator model used by the rule engine and be usable from the existing evaluation flow.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

Scope includes implementing the new operator, adding coverage for its behavior, and updating user-facing documentation so the capability is discoverable. The implementation should use a single radius field input contract and remain consistent with the repository’s existing rule engine conventions.

Constraints include staying within the current rule engine architecture and avoiding assumptions about unsupported input formats. Stakeholders include the rule engine maintainers, the API users who rely on expression-based evaluation, and the project team responsible for validating behavior through tests and documentation.

## Clarified decisions

- The feature will be a value-producing operator rather than a boolean condition operator.
- The operator will accept a single radius field input.
- The acceptance criteria should cover implementation, tests, and documentation.

## Open questions

- None at intake; the clarified decisions above define the current scope.

# ANU-2018 — Design

## Overview

Add a new value-producing operator to the rule engine that evaluates the area of a circle from a single numeric radius input. The operator should follow the existing expression evaluation pipeline and return a numeric result for downstream rules.

## Architecture

- Introduce a new operator definition in the rule engine operator registry.
- Route the operator through the existing evaluation engine so it is treated like other value-producing operators.
- Reuse the current expression parsing and runtime dispatch mechanisms rather than introducing a separate execution path.
- Keep the operator contract narrow: one numeric radius input and one numeric output.

## Data flow

1. The parser recognizes the new operator in rule expressions.
2. The evaluator resolves the radius input and passes it to the operator implementation.
3. The operator computes $A = \pi r^2$ and returns the numeric result.
4. The result is consumed by downstream rule evaluation as a normal value-producing expression.

## Implementation notes

- The implementation should preserve the current operator model and naming conventions.
- The operator should reject unsupported or non-numeric input formats rather than silently coercing them.
- Add unit tests for numeric input, boundary behavior, and invalid input handling.
- Update user-facing documentation to describe the operator and its usage.

## Risks and open questions

- The main risk is introducing inconsistencies with the existing operator conventions.
- No unresolved business questions remain; the approved requirements define the scope.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability adds a new value-producing operator that computes the area of a circle from a numeric radius input and returns the calculated area for downstream rule evaluation. The measurable outcome is that users can express circle-area calculations directly in rules without relying on an external workaround. [ANU-2018:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes adding a new operator to the rule engine, wiring it into the existing expression evaluation flow, and adding tests and documentation for the new capability. It explicitly excludes changing the external rule syntax or introducing support for non-numeric input formats. [ANU-2018:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept a numeric radius input, compute the circle area using the standard formula $A = \pi r^2$, return the resulting numeric value to downstream rules, and be covered by implementation tests and user documentation. [ANU-2018:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing operator registration and evaluation pipeline. Risks include incorrect numeric handling or inconsistent behavior with the current operator conventions. Open questions are none; the current scope is defined by the approved intake and clarified decisions.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

The rule engine needs a new operator that can compute the area of a circle from a radius input and return the calculated area as a value for downstream rule evaluation. The intended outcome is to make this capability available in the existing rule language so users can express calculations directly inside rules without introducing an external workaround.

## Proposed capability

Add support for a new value-producing operator in the rule engine that accepts a numeric radius input and returns the circle area calculation result. The capability should fit the current operator model used by the rule engine and be usable from the existing evaluation flow.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

Scope includes implementing the new operator, adding coverage for its behavior, and updating user-facing documentation so the capability is discoverable. The implementation should use a single radius field input contract and remain consistent with the repository’s existing rule engine conventions.

Constraints include staying within the current rule engine architecture and avoiding assumptions about unsupported input formats. Stakeholders include the rule engine maintainers, the API users who rely on expression-based evaluation, and the project team responsible for validating behavior through tests and documentation.

## Clarified decisions

- The feature will be a value-producing operator rather than a boolean condition operator.
- The operator will accept a single radius field input.
- The acceptance criteria should cover implementation, tests, and documentation.

## Open questions

- None at intake; the clarified decisions above define the current scope.

# ANU-2018 — Implementation Summary

## Agent brief

<!--
Summarize the implemented outcome, consequential decisions, changed surfaces, validation result,
remaining limitations, and rollout considerations for downstream agents. Keep it evidence-based;
the detailed changed-components and test sections are preserved separately.
-->

## Implemented outcome

Implemented a new value-producing `circle_area` operator for the rule engine. When a numeric radius is supplied through the existing data-path resolution, the service computes $A = \pi r^2$ and returns the numeric result; non-numeric input is rejected with an argument error.

## Changed components and decisions

- Added `circle_area` to the operator enum in [src/main/java/org/example/rules/Operator.java](src/main/java/org/example/rules/Operator.java).
- Extended [src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java](src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java) with a value-evaluation path that resolves the input field and computes the circle area using `BigDecimal` with `Math.PI`.
- Added regression tests in [src/test/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineServiceTest.java](src/test/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineServiceTest.java) for numeric radius handling and invalid input rejection.
- Updated [README.md](README.md) to document the new operator and its usage.

## Tests and operational notes

- Verified with `mvn test -q`.
- No migration or rollback steps are required for the existing rule-engine contract; the new operator is additive and preserves the current evaluation flow for existing operators.

# ANU-2018 — Design

## Overview

Add a new value-producing operator to the rule engine that evaluates the area of a circle from a single numeric radius input. The operator should follow the existing expression evaluation pipeline and return a numeric result for downstream rules.

## Architecture

- Introduce a new operator definition in the rule engine operator registry.
- Route the operator through the existing evaluation engine so it is treated like other value-producing operators.
- Reuse the current expression parsing and runtime dispatch mechanisms rather than introducing a separate execution path.
- Keep the operator contract narrow: one numeric radius input and one numeric output.

## Data flow

1. The parser recognizes the new operator in rule expressions.
2. The evaluator resolves the radius input and passes it to the operator implementation.
3. The operator computes $A = \pi r^2$ and returns the numeric result.
4. The result is consumed by downstream rule evaluation as a normal value-producing expression.

## Implementation notes

- The implementation should preserve the current operator model and naming conventions.
- The operator should reject unsupported or non-numeric input formats rather than silently coercing them.
- Add unit tests for numeric input, boundary behavior, and invalid input handling.
- Update user-facing documentation to describe the operator and its usage.

## Risks and open questions

- The main risk is introducing inconsistencies with the existing operator conventions.
- No unresolved business questions remain; the approved requirements define the scope.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability adds a new value-producing operator that computes the area of a circle from a numeric radius input and returns the calculated area for downstream rule evaluation. The measurable outcome is that users can express circle-area calculations directly in rules without relying on an external workaround. [ANU-2018:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes adding a new operator to the rule engine, wiring it into the existing expression evaluation flow, and adding tests and documentation for the new capability. It explicitly excludes changing the external rule syntax or introducing support for non-numeric input formats. [ANU-2018:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept a numeric radius input, compute the circle area using the standard formula $A = \pi r^2$, return the resulting numeric value to downstream rules, and be covered by implementation tests and user documentation. [ANU-2018:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing operator registration and evaluation pipeline. Risks include incorrect numeric handling or inconsistent behavior with the current operator conventions. Open questions are none; the current scope is defined by the approved intake and clarified decisions.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

The rule engine needs a new operator that can compute the area of a circle from a radius input and return the calculated area as a value for downstream rule evaluation. The intended outcome is to make this capability available in the existing rule language so users can express calculations directly inside rules without introducing an external workaround.

## Proposed capability

Add support for a new value-producing operator in the rule engine that accepts a numeric radius input and returns the circle area calculation result. The capability should fit the current operator model used by the rule engine and be usable from the existing evaluation flow.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

Scope includes implementing the new operator, adding coverage for its behavior, and updating user-facing documentation so the capability is discoverable. The implementation should use a single radius field input contract and remain consistent with the repository’s existing rule engine conventions.

Constraints include staying within the current rule engine architecture and avoiding assumptions about unsupported input formats. Stakeholders include the rule engine maintainers, the API users who rely on expression-based evaluation, and the project team responsible for validating behavior through tests and documentation.

## Clarified decisions

- The feature will be a value-producing operator rather than a boolean condition operator.
- The operator will accept a single radius field input.
- The acceptance criteria should cover implementation, tests, and documentation.

## Open questions

- None at intake; the clarified decisions above define the current scope.

# ANU-2018 — Implementation Specification

## Traceability

| Clause | Acceptance criteria | Planned code/tests | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ANU-2018:IFC-001` | `ANU-2018:AC-001` | `RuleEngineService`, `RuleEngineController`, and unit tests | planned |
| `ANU-2018:IFC-002` | `ANU-2018:AC-001` | `RuleEngineService` validation and regression tests | planned |

## APIs, schemas, and contracts

The implementation MUST preserve the existing rule-evaluation contract while introducing one additional value-producing operator for circle-area calculation. The operator contract is narrowly scoped to a single numeric radius input and a single numeric output. [ANU-2018:IFC-001]

The engine MUST continue to evaluate rule expressions through the current parser and dispatcher pipeline, and it MUST reject unsupported or non-numeric input rather than silently coercing it. [ANU-2018:IFC-002]

## File-level implementation plan

- Add a new operator entry to the rule engine operator enum and registry path used by evaluation dispatch.
- Extend the evaluation service so the new operator resolves a radius value from input data, computes $A = \pi r^2$, and returns a numeric result to downstream rule evaluation.
- Preserve the existing behavior for other operators and keep the new operator behind the same parser/evaluator flow used by current value-producing expressions.
- Add unit tests in the existing rule-engine test suite for:
  - valid numeric radius input,
  - boundary behavior with zero and positive values,
  - invalid or non-numeric input handling.
- Update the user-facing documentation and examples to describe the new operator and its usage.

## Security, observability, migration, and rollback

The implementation MUST maintain the current request-validation and error-handling behavior for invalid rule structures and unsupported inputs. Observability remains limited to the existing service-level execution path, and no migration or rollback steps are required beyond preserving backward compatibility for all existing operators. [ANU-2018:CON-002]

## Test specification

- `ANU-2018:REQ-001` → Validate that a rule using the new operator evaluates successfully for a numeric radius and returns the expected computed value.
- `ANU-2018:AC-001` → Validate that the implementation accepts numeric input, computes the circle area using the standard formula, and returns the numeric result for downstream rules.
- `ANU-2018:IFC-001` → Validate that the operator is routed through the existing evaluation path and that unsupported input is rejected with the existing validation behavior.
- `ANU-2018:CON-002` → Validate that existing rule-engine behavior remains intact and no regressions are introduced for other operators.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability adds a new value-producing operator that computes the area of a circle from a numeric radius input and returns the calculated area for downstream rule evaluation. The measurable outcome is that users can express circle-area calculations directly in rules without relying on an external workaround. [ANU-2018:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes adding a new operator to the rule engine, wiring it into the existing expression evaluation flow, and adding tests and documentation for the new capability. It explicitly excludes changing the external rule syntax or introducing support for non-numeric input formats. [ANU-2018:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept a numeric radius input, compute the circle area using the standard formula $A = \pi r^2$, return the resulting numeric value to downstream rules, and be covered by implementation tests and user documentation. [ANU-2018:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing operator registration and evaluation pipeline. Risks include incorrect numeric handling or inconsistent behavior with the current operator conventions. Open questions are none; the current scope is defined by the approved intake and clarified decisions.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

The rule engine needs a new operator that can compute the area of a circle from a radius input and return the calculated area as a value for downstream rule evaluation. The intended outcome is to make this capability available in the existing rule language so users can express calculations directly inside rules without introducing an external workaround.

## Proposed capability

Add support for a new value-producing operator in the rule engine that accepts a numeric radius input and returns the circle area calculation result. The capability should fit the current operator model used by the rule engine and be usable from the existing evaluation flow.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

Scope includes implementing the new operator, adding coverage for its behavior, and updating user-facing documentation so the capability is discoverable. The implementation should use a single radius field input contract and remain consistent with the repository’s existing rule engine conventions.

Constraints include staying within the current rule engine architecture and avoiding assumptions about unsupported input formats. Stakeholders include the rule engine maintainers, the API users who rely on expression-based evaluation, and the project team responsible for validating behavior through tests and documentation.

## Clarified decisions

- The feature will be a value-producing operator rather than a boolean condition operator.
- The operator will accept a single radius field input.
- The acceptance criteria should cover implementation, tests, and documentation.

## Open questions

- None at intake; the clarified decisions above define the current scope.

# ANU-2018 — Design

## Overview

Add a new value-producing operator to the rule engine that evaluates the area of a circle from a single numeric radius input. The operator should follow the existing expression evaluation pipeline and return a numeric result for downstream rules.

## Architecture

- Introduce a new operator definition in the rule engine operator registry.
- Route the operator through the existing evaluation engine so it is treated like other value-producing operators.
- Reuse the current expression parsing and runtime dispatch mechanisms rather than introducing a separate execution path.
- Keep the operator contract narrow: one numeric radius input and one numeric output.

## Data flow

1. The parser recognizes the new operator in rule expressions.
2. The evaluator resolves the radius input and passes it to the operator implementation.
3. The operator computes $A = \pi r^2$ and returns the numeric result.
4. The result is consumed by downstream rule evaluation as a normal value-producing expression.

## Implementation notes

- The implementation should preserve the current operator model and naming conventions.
- The operator should reject unsupported or non-numeric input formats rather than silently coercing them.
- Add unit tests for numeric input, boundary behavior, and invalid input handling.
- Update user-facing documentation to describe the operator and its usage.

## Risks and open questions

- The main risk is introducing inconsistencies with the existing operator conventions.
- No unresolved business questions remain; the approved requirements define the scope.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability adds a new value-producing operator that computes the area of a circle from a numeric radius input and returns the calculated area for downstream rule evaluation. The measurable outcome is that users can express circle-area calculations directly in rules without relying on an external workaround. [ANU-2018:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes adding a new operator to the rule engine, wiring it into the existing expression evaluation flow, and adding tests and documentation for the new capability. It explicitly excludes changing the external rule syntax or introducing support for non-numeric input formats. [ANU-2018:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept a numeric radius input, compute the circle area using the standard formula $A = \pi r^2$, return the resulting numeric value to downstream rules, and be covered by implementation tests and user documentation. [ANU-2018:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing operator registration and evaluation pipeline. Risks include incorrect numeric handling or inconsistent behavior with the current operator conventions. Open questions are none; the current scope is defined by the approved intake and clarified decisions.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

The rule engine needs a new operator that can compute the area of a circle from a radius input and return the calculated area as a value for downstream rule evaluation. The intended outcome is to make this capability available in the existing rule language so users can express calculations directly inside rules without introducing an external workaround.

## Proposed capability

Add support for a new value-producing operator in the rule engine that accepts a numeric radius input and returns the circle area calculation result. The capability should fit the current operator model used by the rule engine and be usable from the existing evaluation flow.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

Scope includes implementing the new operator, adding coverage for its behavior, and updating user-facing documentation so the capability is discoverable. The implementation should use a single radius field input contract and remain consistent with the repository’s existing rule engine conventions.

Constraints include staying within the current rule engine architecture and avoiding assumptions about unsupported input formats. Stakeholders include the rule engine maintainers, the API users who rely on expression-based evaluation, and the project team responsible for validating behavior through tests and documentation.

## Clarified decisions

- The feature will be a value-producing operator rather than a boolean condition operator.
- The operator will accept a single radius field input.
- The acceptance criteria should cover implementation, tests, and documentation.

## Open questions

- None at intake; the clarified decisions above define the current scope.

# ANU-2018 — Verification Evidence

## Agent brief

Verified the new circle-area value-producing operator end to end. The implementation accepts a numeric radius, computes $A = \pi r^2$, returns a numeric result for downstream evaluation, and rejects non-numeric or negative input with explicit argument errors. The new behavior is covered by regression tests and the existing rule-engine suite remains green. Residual risk is low; the feature is narrowly scoped and preserves the existing operator contract.

## Commands and environment

- Command: `mvn test -q`
- Environment: macOS, Java 26.0.1, Maven, Spring Boot test context
- Outcome: Passed; the test suite completed successfully with no reported failures.
- Additional verification: the new operator behavior was exercised through dedicated regression tests for numeric success and invalid input handling.

## Acceptance and specification results

- `ANU-2018:AC-001`: Verified. The implementation accepts numeric radius input, computes the circle area using the standard formula, returns the numeric result for downstream rules, and is covered by implementation tests and documentation.
- `ANU-2018:IFC-001`: Verified. The operator is routed through the existing evaluation path and unsupported input is rejected rather than silently coerced.
- `ANU-2018:IFC-002`: Verified. Existing evaluation behavior remains intact for other operators and the new behavior is isolated to the value-producing operator path.
- `ANU-2018:REQ-001`: Verified. A rule using the new operator evaluates successfully for numeric input and returns the expected computed value.

## Negative, regression, security, and non-functional checks

- Negative input handling: verified for non-numeric input and negative radius values, both of which now raise explicit argument errors.
- Regression check: existing rule-engine tests passed after the change.
- Security and non-functional impact: none beyond the local validation path; no migration, deployment, or external interface changes were introduced.

# ANU-2018 — Implementation Specification

## Traceability

| Clause | Acceptance criteria | Planned code/tests | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ANU-2018:IFC-001` | `ANU-2018:AC-001` | `RuleEngineService`, `RuleEngineController`, and unit tests | planned |
| `ANU-2018:IFC-002` | `ANU-2018:AC-001` | `RuleEngineService` validation and regression tests | planned |

## APIs, schemas, and contracts

The implementation MUST preserve the existing rule-evaluation contract while introducing one additional value-producing operator for circle-area calculation. The operator contract is narrowly scoped to a single numeric radius input and a single numeric output. [ANU-2018:IFC-001]

The engine MUST continue to evaluate rule expressions through the current parser and dispatcher pipeline, and it MUST reject unsupported or non-numeric input rather than silently coercing it. [ANU-2018:IFC-002]

## File-level implementation plan

- Add a new operator entry to the rule engine operator enum and registry path used by evaluation dispatch.
- Extend the evaluation service so the new operator resolves a radius value from input data, computes $A = \pi r^2$, and returns a numeric result to downstream rule evaluation.
- Preserve the existing behavior for other operators and keep the new operator behind the same parser/evaluator flow used by current value-producing expressions.
- Add unit tests in the existing rule-engine test suite for:
  - valid numeric radius input,
  - boundary behavior with zero and positive values,
  - invalid or non-numeric input handling.
- Update the user-facing documentation and examples to describe the new operator and its usage.

## Security, observability, migration, and rollback

The implementation MUST maintain the current request-validation and error-handling behavior for invalid rule structures and unsupported inputs. Observability remains limited to the existing service-level execution path, and no migration or rollback steps are required beyond preserving backward compatibility for all existing operators. [ANU-2018:CON-002]

## Test specification

- `ANU-2018:REQ-001` → Validate that a rule using the new operator evaluates successfully for a numeric radius and returns the expected computed value.
- `ANU-2018:AC-001` → Validate that the implementation accepts numeric input, computes the circle area using the standard formula, and returns the numeric result for downstream rules.
- `ANU-2018:IFC-001` → Validate that the operator is routed through the existing evaluation path and that unsupported input is rejected with the existing validation behavior.
- `ANU-2018:CON-002` → Validate that existing rule-engine behavior remains intact and no regressions are introduced for other operators.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability adds a new value-producing operator that computes the area of a circle from a numeric radius input and returns the calculated area for downstream rule evaluation. The measurable outcome is that users can express circle-area calculations directly in rules without relying on an external workaround. [ANU-2018:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes adding a new operator to the rule engine, wiring it into the existing expression evaluation flow, and adding tests and documentation for the new capability. It explicitly excludes changing the external rule syntax or introducing support for non-numeric input formats. [ANU-2018:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept a numeric radius input, compute the circle area using the standard formula $A = \pi r^2$, return the resulting numeric value to downstream rules, and be covered by implementation tests and user documentation. [ANU-2018:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing operator registration and evaluation pipeline. Risks include incorrect numeric handling or inconsistent behavior with the current operator conventions. Open questions are none; the current scope is defined by the approved intake and clarified decisions.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

The rule engine needs a new operator that can compute the area of a circle from a radius input and return the calculated area as a value for downstream rule evaluation. The intended outcome is to make this capability available in the existing rule language so users can express calculations directly inside rules without introducing an external workaround.

## Proposed capability

Add support for a new value-producing operator in the rule engine that accepts a numeric radius input and returns the circle area calculation result. The capability should fit the current operator model used by the rule engine and be usable from the existing evaluation flow.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

Scope includes implementing the new operator, adding coverage for its behavior, and updating user-facing documentation so the capability is discoverable. The implementation should use a single radius field input contract and remain consistent with the repository’s existing rule engine conventions.

Constraints include staying within the current rule engine architecture and avoiding assumptions about unsupported input formats. Stakeholders include the rule engine maintainers, the API users who rely on expression-based evaluation, and the project team responsible for validating behavior through tests and documentation.

## Clarified decisions

- The feature will be a value-producing operator rather than a boolean condition operator.
- The operator will accept a single radius field input.
- The acceptance criteria should cover implementation, tests, and documentation.

## Open questions

- None at intake; the clarified decisions above define the current scope.

# ANU-2018 — Design

## Overview

Add a new value-producing operator to the rule engine that evaluates the area of a circle from a single numeric radius input. The operator should follow the existing expression evaluation pipeline and return a numeric result for downstream rules.

## Architecture

- Introduce a new operator definition in the rule engine operator registry.
- Route the operator through the existing evaluation engine so it is treated like other value-producing operators.
- Reuse the current expression parsing and runtime dispatch mechanisms rather than introducing a separate execution path.
- Keep the operator contract narrow: one numeric radius input and one numeric output.

## Data flow

1. The parser recognizes the new operator in rule expressions.
2. The evaluator resolves the radius input and passes it to the operator implementation.
3. The operator computes $A = \pi r^2$ and returns the numeric result.
4. The result is consumed by downstream rule evaluation as a normal value-producing expression.

## Implementation notes

- The implementation should preserve the current operator model and naming conventions.
- The operator should reject unsupported or non-numeric input formats rather than silently coercing them.
- Add unit tests for numeric input, boundary behavior, and invalid input handling.
- Update user-facing documentation to describe the operator and its usage.

## Risks and open questions

- The main risk is introducing inconsistencies with the existing operator conventions.
- No unresolved business questions remain; the approved requirements define the scope.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability adds a new value-producing operator that computes the area of a circle from a numeric radius input and returns the calculated area for downstream rule evaluation. The measurable outcome is that users can express circle-area calculations directly in rules without relying on an external workaround. [ANU-2018:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes adding a new operator to the rule engine, wiring it into the existing expression evaluation flow, and adding tests and documentation for the new capability. It explicitly excludes changing the external rule syntax or introducing support for non-numeric input formats. [ANU-2018:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept a numeric radius input, compute the circle area using the standard formula $A = \pi r^2$, return the resulting numeric value to downstream rules, and be covered by implementation tests and user documentation. [ANU-2018:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing operator registration and evaluation pipeline. Risks include incorrect numeric handling or inconsistent behavior with the current operator conventions. Open questions are none; the current scope is defined by the approved intake and clarified decisions.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

The rule engine needs a new operator that can compute the area of a circle from a radius input and return the calculated area as a value for downstream rule evaluation. The intended outcome is to make this capability available in the existing rule language so users can express calculations directly inside rules without introducing an external workaround.

## Proposed capability

Add support for a new value-producing operator in the rule engine that accepts a numeric radius input and returns the circle area calculation result. The capability should fit the current operator model used by the rule engine and be usable from the existing evaluation flow.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

Scope includes implementing the new operator, adding coverage for its behavior, and updating user-facing documentation so the capability is discoverable. The implementation should use a single radius field input contract and remain consistent with the repository’s existing rule engine conventions.

Constraints include staying within the current rule engine architecture and avoiding assumptions about unsupported input formats. Stakeholders include the rule engine maintainers, the API users who rely on expression-based evaluation, and the project team responsible for validating behavior through tests and documentation.

## Clarified decisions

- The feature will be a value-producing operator rather than a boolean condition operator.
- The operator will accept a single radius field input.
- The acceptance criteria should cover implementation, tests, and documentation.

## Open questions

- None at intake; the clarified decisions above define the current scope.

# ANU-2018 — Implementation Summary

## Agent brief

<!--
Summarize the implemented outcome, consequential decisions, changed surfaces, validation result,
remaining limitations, and rollout considerations for downstream agents. Keep it evidence-based;
the detailed changed-components and test sections are preserved separately.
-->

## Implemented outcome

Implemented a new value-producing `circle_area` operator for the rule engine. When a numeric radius is supplied through the existing data-path resolution, the service computes $A = \pi r^2$ and returns the numeric result; non-numeric input is rejected with an argument error.

## Changed components and decisions

- Added `circle_area` to the operator enum in [src/main/java/org/example/rules/Operator.java](src/main/java/org/example/rules/Operator.java).
- Extended [src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java](src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java) with a value-evaluation path that resolves the input field and computes the circle area using `BigDecimal` with `Math.PI`.
- Added regression tests in [src/test/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineServiceTest.java](src/test/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineServiceTest.java) for numeric radius handling and invalid input rejection.
- Updated [README.md](README.md) to document the new operator and its usage.

## Tests and operational notes

- Verified with `mvn test -q`.
- No migration or rollback steps are required for the existing rule-engine contract; the new operator is additive and preserves the current evaluation flow for existing operators.

# ANU-2018 — Design

## Overview

Add a new value-producing operator to the rule engine that evaluates the area of a circle from a single numeric radius input. The operator should follow the existing expression evaluation pipeline and return a numeric result for downstream rules.

## Architecture

- Introduce a new operator definition in the rule engine operator registry.
- Route the operator through the existing evaluation engine so it is treated like other value-producing operators.
- Reuse the current expression parsing and runtime dispatch mechanisms rather than introducing a separate execution path.
- Keep the operator contract narrow: one numeric radius input and one numeric output.

## Data flow

1. The parser recognizes the new operator in rule expressions.
2. The evaluator resolves the radius input and passes it to the operator implementation.
3. The operator computes $A = \pi r^2$ and returns the numeric result.
4. The result is consumed by downstream rule evaluation as a normal value-producing expression.

## Implementation notes

- The implementation should preserve the current operator model and naming conventions.
- The operator should reject unsupported or non-numeric input formats rather than silently coercing them.
- Add unit tests for numeric input, boundary behavior, and invalid input handling.
- Update user-facing documentation to describe the operator and its usage.

## Risks and open questions

- The main risk is introducing inconsistencies with the existing operator conventions.
- No unresolved business questions remain; the approved requirements define the scope.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability adds a new value-producing operator that computes the area of a circle from a numeric radius input and returns the calculated area for downstream rule evaluation. The measurable outcome is that users can express circle-area calculations directly in rules without relying on an external workaround. [ANU-2018:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes adding a new operator to the rule engine, wiring it into the existing expression evaluation flow, and adding tests and documentation for the new capability. It explicitly excludes changing the external rule syntax or introducing support for non-numeric input formats. [ANU-2018:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept a numeric radius input, compute the circle area using the standard formula $A = \pi r^2$, return the resulting numeric value to downstream rules, and be covered by implementation tests and user documentation. [ANU-2018:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing operator registration and evaluation pipeline. Risks include incorrect numeric handling or inconsistent behavior with the current operator conventions. Open questions are none; the current scope is defined by the approved intake and clarified decisions.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

The rule engine needs a new operator that can compute the area of a circle from a radius input and return the calculated area as a value for downstream rule evaluation. The intended outcome is to make this capability available in the existing rule language so users can express calculations directly inside rules without introducing an external workaround.

## Proposed capability

Add support for a new value-producing operator in the rule engine that accepts a numeric radius input and returns the circle area calculation result. The capability should fit the current operator model used by the rule engine and be usable from the existing evaluation flow.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

Scope includes implementing the new operator, adding coverage for its behavior, and updating user-facing documentation so the capability is discoverable. The implementation should use a single radius field input contract and remain consistent with the repository’s existing rule engine conventions.

Constraints include staying within the current rule engine architecture and avoiding assumptions about unsupported input formats. Stakeholders include the rule engine maintainers, the API users who rely on expression-based evaluation, and the project team responsible for validating behavior through tests and documentation.

## Clarified decisions

- The feature will be a value-producing operator rather than a boolean condition operator.
- The operator will accept a single radius field input.
- The acceptance criteria should cover implementation, tests, and documentation.

## Open questions

- None at intake; the clarified decisions above define the current scope.

# ANU-2018 — Implementation Specification

## Traceability

| Clause | Acceptance criteria | Planned code/tests | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ANU-2018:IFC-001` | `ANU-2018:AC-001` | `RuleEngineService`, `RuleEngineController`, and unit tests | planned |
| `ANU-2018:IFC-002` | `ANU-2018:AC-001` | `RuleEngineService` validation and regression tests | planned |

## APIs, schemas, and contracts

The implementation MUST preserve the existing rule-evaluation contract while introducing one additional value-producing operator for circle-area calculation. The operator contract is narrowly scoped to a single numeric radius input and a single numeric output. [ANU-2018:IFC-001]

The engine MUST continue to evaluate rule expressions through the current parser and dispatcher pipeline, and it MUST reject unsupported or non-numeric input rather than silently coercing it. [ANU-2018:IFC-002]

## File-level implementation plan

- Add a new operator entry to the rule engine operator enum and registry path used by evaluation dispatch.
- Extend the evaluation service so the new operator resolves a radius value from input data, computes $A = \pi r^2$, and returns a numeric result to downstream rule evaluation.
- Preserve the existing behavior for other operators and keep the new operator behind the same parser/evaluator flow used by current value-producing expressions.
- Add unit tests in the existing rule-engine test suite for:
  - valid numeric radius input,
  - boundary behavior with zero and positive values,
  - invalid or non-numeric input handling.
- Update the user-facing documentation and examples to describe the new operator and its usage.

## Security, observability, migration, and rollback

The implementation MUST maintain the current request-validation and error-handling behavior for invalid rule structures and unsupported inputs. Observability remains limited to the existing service-level execution path, and no migration or rollback steps are required beyond preserving backward compatibility for all existing operators. [ANU-2018:CON-002]

## Test specification

- `ANU-2018:REQ-001` → Validate that a rule using the new operator evaluates successfully for a numeric radius and returns the expected computed value.
- `ANU-2018:AC-001` → Validate that the implementation accepts numeric input, computes the circle area using the standard formula, and returns the numeric result for downstream rules.
- `ANU-2018:IFC-001` → Validate that the operator is routed through the existing evaluation path and that unsupported input is rejected with the existing validation behavior.
- `ANU-2018:CON-002` → Validate that existing rule-engine behavior remains intact and no regressions are introduced for other operators.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability adds a new value-producing operator that computes the area of a circle from a numeric radius input and returns the calculated area for downstream rule evaluation. The measurable outcome is that users can express circle-area calculations directly in rules without relying on an external workaround. [ANU-2018:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes adding a new operator to the rule engine, wiring it into the existing expression evaluation flow, and adding tests and documentation for the new capability. It explicitly excludes changing the external rule syntax or introducing support for non-numeric input formats. [ANU-2018:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept a numeric radius input, compute the circle area using the standard formula $A = \pi r^2$, return the resulting numeric value to downstream rules, and be covered by implementation tests and user documentation. [ANU-2018:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing operator registration and evaluation pipeline. Risks include incorrect numeric handling or inconsistent behavior with the current operator conventions. Open questions are none; the current scope is defined by the approved intake and clarified decisions.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

The rule engine needs a new operator that can compute the area of a circle from a radius input and return the calculated area as a value for downstream rule evaluation. The intended outcome is to make this capability available in the existing rule language so users can express calculations directly inside rules without introducing an external workaround.

## Proposed capability

Add support for a new value-producing operator in the rule engine that accepts a numeric radius input and returns the circle area calculation result. The capability should fit the current operator model used by the rule engine and be usable from the existing evaluation flow.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

Scope includes implementing the new operator, adding coverage for its behavior, and updating user-facing documentation so the capability is discoverable. The implementation should use a single radius field input contract and remain consistent with the repository’s existing rule engine conventions.

Constraints include staying within the current rule engine architecture and avoiding assumptions about unsupported input formats. Stakeholders include the rule engine maintainers, the API users who rely on expression-based evaluation, and the project team responsible for validating behavior through tests and documentation.

## Clarified decisions

- The feature will be a value-producing operator rather than a boolean condition operator.
- The operator will accept a single radius field input.
- The acceptance criteria should cover implementation, tests, and documentation.

## Open questions

- None at intake; the clarified decisions above define the current scope.

# ANU-2018 — Design

## Overview

Add a new value-producing operator to the rule engine that evaluates the area of a circle from a single numeric radius input. The operator should follow the existing expression evaluation pipeline and return a numeric result for downstream rules.

## Architecture

- Introduce a new operator definition in the rule engine operator registry.
- Route the operator through the existing evaluation engine so it is treated like other value-producing operators.
- Reuse the current expression parsing and runtime dispatch mechanisms rather than introducing a separate execution path.
- Keep the operator contract narrow: one numeric radius input and one numeric output.

## Data flow

1. The parser recognizes the new operator in rule expressions.
2. The evaluator resolves the radius input and passes it to the operator implementation.
3. The operator computes $A = \pi r^2$ and returns the numeric result.
4. The result is consumed by downstream rule evaluation as a normal value-producing expression.

## Implementation notes

- The implementation should preserve the current operator model and naming conventions.
- The operator should reject unsupported or non-numeric input formats rather than silently coercing them.
- Add unit tests for numeric input, boundary behavior, and invalid input handling.
- Update user-facing documentation to describe the operator and its usage.

## Risks and open questions

- The main risk is introducing inconsistencies with the existing operator conventions.
- No unresolved business questions remain; the approved requirements define the scope.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability adds a new value-producing operator that computes the area of a circle from a numeric radius input and returns the calculated area for downstream rule evaluation. The measurable outcome is that users can express circle-area calculations directly in rules without relying on an external workaround. [ANU-2018:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes adding a new operator to the rule engine, wiring it into the existing expression evaluation flow, and adding tests and documentation for the new capability. It explicitly excludes changing the external rule syntax or introducing support for non-numeric input formats. [ANU-2018:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept a numeric radius input, compute the circle area using the standard formula $A = \pi r^2$, return the resulting numeric value to downstream rules, and be covered by implementation tests and user documentation. [ANU-2018:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing operator registration and evaluation pipeline. Risks include incorrect numeric handling or inconsistent behavior with the current operator conventions. Open questions are none; the current scope is defined by the approved intake and clarified decisions.

# ANU-2018 — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

The rule engine needs a new operator that can compute the area of a circle from a radius input and return the calculated area as a value for downstream rule evaluation. The intended outcome is to make this capability available in the existing rule language so users can express calculations directly inside rules without introducing an external workaround.

## Proposed capability

Add support for a new value-producing operator in the rule engine that accepts a numeric radius input and returns the circle area calculation result. The capability should fit the current operator model used by the rule engine and be usable from the existing evaluation flow.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

Scope includes implementing the new operator, adding coverage for its behavior, and updating user-facing documentation so the capability is discoverable. The implementation should use a single radius field input contract and remain consistent with the repository’s existing rule engine conventions.

Constraints include staying within the current rule engine architecture and avoiding assumptions about unsupported input formats. Stakeholders include the rule engine maintainers, the API users who rely on expression-based evaluation, and the project team responsible for validating behavior through tests and documentation.

## Clarified decisions

- The feature will be a value-producing operator rather than a boolean condition operator.
- The operator will accept a single radius field input.
- The acceptance criteria should cover implementation, tests, and documentation.

## Open questions

- None at intake; the clarified decisions above define the current scope.
