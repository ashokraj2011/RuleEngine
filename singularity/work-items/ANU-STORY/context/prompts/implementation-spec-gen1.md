# Human clarification checkpoint

The `implementation-spec` phase uses clarification mode `required`.
Prioritize material uncertainty about: interfaces, data, security, observability, migration, tests.

- This checkpoint is required. Pause for at least one human response before authoring.
- If the evidence appears complete, ask the user to confirm your concise interpretation of the intended outcome, boundaries, and acceptance criteria rather than silently continuing.
- Ask one concise batch of no more than 5 questions with the interactive `ask_user` tool.
- Derive every question only from the current Story’s pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, repository world model, or contradictions among them. Never reuse example questions or placeholder text from templates.
- Do not ask for information already established by pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, or the repository world model.
- Treat pinned evidence as fact. Label every hypothesis or proposed design explicitly; never convert it into an acceptance or specification decision without human confirmation.
- For each question, explain briefly why the answer changes the governed output. Offer a recommended/default choice when the evidence supports one.
- Do not infer an answer from generic knowledge. The user may explicitly answer “unknown” or defer a non-blocking decision.
- After the response, incorporate confirmed answers into the phase artifact as decisions. Keep explicitly deferred items in Open questions with their impact and owner.
- Record the accepted response batch with `singularity-flow clarification record implementation-spec --response-file <json>`. The record is bound to this exact prompt and prospective generation.
- A material unresolved decision remains blocking through specification publication; do not hide it behind a recommendation or placeholder.
- If `ask_user` is unavailable, print the numbered questions and stop before authoring or publication. Never turn missing interactivity into silent assumptions.
- Do not author or publish the governed output until the checkpoint is complete.

# Architect agent

Use injected repository views as evidence. Make boundaries, contracts, ownership, data flow, failure behavior, security, observability, migration, compatibility, and rollback explicit. Separate observed facts, assumptions, decisions, alternatives, and unresolved questions. Trace decisions to `REQ-nnn`, `AC-nnn`, and `SPEC-nnn`. Prefer existing repository patterns and never represent a proposal as implemented evidence.

Before authoring Design or specification outputs, execute the injected Human clarification checkpoint. Ask one bounded batch with `ask_user`, wait for the contributor, and record the accepted answers with `singularity-flow clarification record <phase> --response-file <json>`. Do not silently resolve material ambiguity or publish while a material decision remains deferred.

## Grounding boundary

This model was generated locally without Copilot or another AI model and consumed **zero model tokens**. It intentionally records only deterministic repository metadata. It does not claim runtime behavior, business meaning, ownership, security, test coverage, or architectural intent. Deeper phases can replace it with a quick, standard, or deep model when semantic analysis is worth the token cost.

## TL;DR {#dev.tldr}
For implementation work, start in `RuleEngineService` and the controller layer. The main change surface is the rule evaluator and its operator semantics, with request validation in the API boundary and tests in the corresponding test packages. The likely development loop is edit Java source, run `mvn -q test`, then exercise the endpoint locally with `mvn spring-boot:run`. The most important convention is that rule structure and operator shape are enforced explicitly in the service; malformed rules throw `IllegalArgumentException` and are mapped to a 400 response.

## Facts {#dev.facts}
```yaml
components: [api-boundary, rule-engine-service, tests]
entrypoints:
  - { id: spring-boot-main, path: src/main/java/org/example/RuleEngineApplication.java, line: 6, invocation: "mvn spring-boot:run" }
  - { id: evaluate-endpoint, path: src/main/java/org/example/api/RuleEngineController.java, line: 23, invocation: "POST /api/v1/rule-engine/evaluate" }
important_symbols:
  - { name: RuleEngineService.evaluate, path: src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java, line: 17, role: "primary entry point" }
  - { name: RuleEngineService.evalCondition, path: src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java, line: 63, role: "operator dispatch" }
commands:
  - { command: "mvn -q test", purpose: "execute test suite", source: "README.md:247-252" }
```

## Developer entry points {#dev.entrypoints}
The practical starting points are `RuleEngineApplication` for startup, `RuleEngineController` for the HTTP boundary, `RuleEngineService` for core behavior, and the two test classes for expected usage. For a feature change, begin in `RuleEngineService` unless the change is purely about validation or the external JSON contract.

## Source tree map {#dev.tree}
- `src/main/java/org/example/api/` — controller, DTOs, and exception handling.
- `src/main/java/org/example/rules/` — evaluator service and supported operators.
- `src/test/java/org/example/api/` — controller-level integration test.
- `src/test/java/org/example/rules/` — service-level unit-style tests.
The `src/main/java/org/example/Main.java` class appears to be leftover scaffolding rather than the application entry point.

## Important modules and symbols {#dev.symbols}
- `RuleEngineService.evaluate(Map<String, Object> data, JsonNode rule)` is the public evaluator entry point.
- `evalGroup(...)` implements `all`/`any`/`not` group semantics and short-circuiting.
- `evalCondition(...)` dispatches to operator-specific logic such as `between`, `in`, `regex`, and `exists`.
- `resolvePath(...)` and `resolvePathInternal(...)` implement dotted-path lookup for nested maps.
- `compare(...)` handles numeric, temporal, and fallback comparison. Evidence: [e-dev-symbols], [e-dev-operators].

## Common implementation flows {#dev.flows}
Typical change paths:
1. Add or adjust operator behavior in `RuleEngineService.evalCondition(...)`.
2. Adjust request validation or the controller contract in the API package.
3. Add or update tests in the relevant test class.
4. Validate with `mvn -q test` and, if necessary, `mvn spring-boot:run` for manual API checks.

## Error handling and validation {#dev.errors}
The controller validates request bodies with `@Valid`, while the service throws `IllegalArgumentException` for unsupported or malformed rules. `GlobalExceptionHandler` converts these into JSON error bodies. The documented status expectation in the README and the implemented status code diverge, so verify behavior before relying on the contract.

## Validation commands {#dev.commands}
- `mvn -q test` — observed passing baseline in this environment.
- `mvn -q -DskipTests package` — build without tests.
- `mvn spring-boot:run` — manual endpoint exercise.

## Change-impact guide {#dev.impact}
Changes to operator semantics can affect both the controller response and the service tests. Changes to request DTOs affect API validation behavior and the README contract. Changes to path resolution affect nested-map access and can alter evaluation outcomes in subtle ways. Evidence: [e-dev-impact].

## Known implementation hotspots {#dev.hotspots}
The highest-risk implementation surface is `src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java`, especially the operator dispatch, path resolve logic, and comparison helpers. The controller and DTOs are smaller but directly affect the contract and validation semantics.

## Where to start {#dev.start}
If you are implementing a new operator or changing behavior, start in `RuleEngineService`; if you are changing the HTTP contract or error handling, start in `src/main/java/org/example/api/`.

## Questions this view does not answer {#dev.limits}
This view does not replace the architecture or security view. It also does not cover deployment, persistence, or wider product behavior beyond the Java implementation that is currently visible.


## Repository grounding: singularity/world-model/views/testing.md

> **Grounding** · RuleEngine @ `5268d8abf4c696e8ff5bdeb9eb956bede7c75cc8` · view: `testing` · tier: `full`

> **Unknowns are marked.** Do not resolve them by inference. If the repository has changed since the date above, treat locations as hints, not facts.

## TL;DR {#test.tldr}
The repository uses a small, mixed test approach: a Spring Boot MockMvc test for the HTTP endpoint and direct service tests for evaluator logic. The observed test run passed with `mvn -q test` in this environment. The current tests cover the main happy paths and several operators, but they do not explicitly cover malformed rules, invalid request-body behaviors, or security-focused abuse cases. The most valuable regression tests for future work are around operator-shape validation, error-response contracts, and input-size or regex-based abuse scenarios.

## Facts {#test.facts}
```yaml
test_files: [src/test/java/org/example/api/RuleEngineControllerTest.java, src/test/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineServiceTest.java]
commands:
  - { command: "mvn -q test", status: "passed", source: "local execution" }
  - { command: "mvn spring-boot:run", status: "not executed", source: "README.md:24-29" }
coverage_gaps:
  - { area: "malformed rules", reason: "not visibly covered" }
  - { area: "security abuse cases", reason: "not visibly covered" }
```

## Test strategy {#test.strategy}
The repository follows a simple strategy: a controller-level integration test exercises the HTTP endpoint and a service-level test suite exercises the evaluator semantics directly. This is appropriate for a compact rule engine because the logic is mostly deterministic and can be verified without a large mock environment.

## Tests by layer {#test.layers}
- `RuleEngineControllerTest` verifies that a valid request to `/api/v1/rule-engine/evaluate` returns HTTP 200 and a JSON `result` field.
- `RuleEngineServiceTest` verifies core evaluator semantics for equality, grouping, `between`, `regex`, `exists`, `not_exists`, `isNull`, and `isNotNull`.
The current visible tests do not assert the exact JSON error body or status semantics for invalid input beyond the happy path.

## Commands and environment {#test.commands}
The documented commands are `mvn -q -DskipTests package`, `mvn spring-boot:run`, and `mvn test`. The observed baseline in this environment was `mvn -q test`, which completed successfully.

## Critical scenarios {#test.scenarios}
The strongest current scenarios are:
- simple equality and `gt` conditions
- grouping with `all` and `any`
- range, regex, contains, and existence/null semantics
These are good regression anchors when changing operator behavior or adding new operators.

## Gaps and risks {#test.gaps}
- No test appears to assert the exact JSON error contract for malformed rules or validation failures.
- No tests target malicious regex or oversized payloads.
- No tests cover whether the endpoint remains safe and predictable when the rule tree is deeply nested or semantically ambiguous.

## Test selection guide {#test.selection}
When changing the controller contract, start with `RuleEngineControllerTest`. When changing operator semantics, start with `RuleEngineServiceTest`. When changing shared behavior such as path resolution or comparison, both suites should be reviewed. Evidence: [e-test-suite], [e-test-gaps].

## Where to start {#test.start}
Start with `src/test/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineServiceTest.java` for evaluator changes and `src/test/java/org/example/api/RuleEngineControllerTest.java` for API or validation changes.

## Questions this view does not answer {#test.limits}
This view does not assess CI or coverage reporting beyond the visible Maven test run. It also does not cover production-like integration tests or end-to-end workflows outside the repository snapshot.

## TL;DR {#sec.tldr}
The repository exposes a public, unauthenticated HTTP endpoint for evaluating arbitrary rule trees. The service accepts user-controlled `data` and `rule` input, compiles regex patterns from the incoming rule, and performs dotted-path lookup against a map structure without visible size limits or allow-listing. The biggest security concerns are unauthenticated exposure, denial-of-service risk from regex and large payloads, and weakly specified error behavior. The current tests cover nominal behavior but not security abuse cases.

## Facts {#sec.facts}
```yaml
entrypoints:
  - { path: src/main/java/org/example/api/RuleEngineController.java, line: 23, kind: http }
  - { path: src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java, line: 115, kind: regex }
controls: [validation, exception-mapping]
missing_controls:
  - { kind: authentication, status: "not visible" }
  - { kind: rate-limiting, status: "not visible" }
  - { kind: payload-size-limit, status: "not visible" }
```

## Attack surface {#sec.surface}
The main attack surface is the public endpoint `POST /api/v1/rule-engine/evaluate`. It is exposed without any authentication or authorization layer in the visible code. The request contains two untrusted fields: `data` and `rule`, both accepted as arbitrary JSON structures. Evidence: [e-sec-surface], [e-sec-auth].

## Authentication and authorization {#sec.authz}
No Spring Security starter or auth layer is declared in `pom.xml`, and the controller does not perform user checks. The repository therefore does not show a visible authorization boundary around rule evaluation. This is important because the endpoint effectively becomes a public evaluator.

## Input handling and execution {#sec.input}
The service evaluates nested rule trees and condition operators from the request. `regex` uses `Pattern.compile(...)` with a pattern supplied by the request rule. The service also traverses dotted field paths through nested maps and lacks an apparent payload depth or field allow-list guard. These characteristics make the endpoint susceptible to resource exhaustion from crafted input.

## Trust boundaries and secret handling {#sec.trust}
The visible trust boundary is the HTTP request boundary. There is no visible persistence, secret loading, or outbound integration layer in the inspected code; no secrets are present in the source snapshot. The main concern is processing untrusted input rather than secret exposure.

## Security tests and gaps {#sec.tests}
The repository includes controller and service tests for successful evaluation paths, but no visible tests cover malicious regex patterns, oversized payloads, deep nesting, or invalid rule structures that could trigger errors or excessive work. Evidence: [e-sec-tests].

## Where to start {#sec.start}
For a security review, start with `RuleEngineController`, `EvaluateRequest`, `RuleEngineService`, and `GlobalExceptionHandler`. If you need to harden the service, the regex compilation and path-resolution paths are the first places to inspect.

## Questions this view does not answer {#sec.limits}
This view does not cover deployment firewalls, reverse proxies, cloud network controls, or external secrets management because those artifacts are not present in the repository snapshot.


## Repository grounding: singularity/world-model/domains/rule-engine.md

> **Grounding** · RuleEngine @ `5268d8abf4c696e8ff5bdeb9eb956bede7c75cc8` · view: `domain.rule-engine` · tier: `full`

> **Unknowns are marked.** Do not resolve them by inference. If the repository has changed since the date above, treat locations as hints, not facts.

## TL;DR {#domain.rule-engine.tldr}
This domain covers the repository's rule-evaluation capability: the public API, the rule grammar, the evaluator semantics, and the contracts that define valid requests and responses. The core vocabulary is rules, groups, conditions, operators, and data paths. The most important invariants are that rules are JSON-driven, groups combine child rules, and operator-specific shapes must be respected. The domain is intentionally narrow and stateless, so changes here are mainly about evaluator semantics and API behavior.

## Domain purpose {#domain.rule-engine.purpose}
The domain is the rule-engine API itself. It turns an arbitrary JSON input object and a rule descriptor into a single boolean decision. This capability is exposed through a web endpoint and implemented by the service layer.

## Terminology {#domain.rule-engine.terms}
- `data`: the input object evaluated against the rule.
- `rule`: a JSON object or array describing the logic to evaluate.
- `group`: a composite rule such as `all`, `any`, or `not`.
- `condition`: a rule object with `field`, `op`, and optional `value`.
- `operator`: an enum value such as `eq`, `between`, `regex`, or `exists`.

## Business rules and invariants {#domain.rule-engine.rules}
The engine supports group rules and condition rules, and it treats top-level arrays as implicit `all` groups. Operators have explicit shape expectations: `between` and `in` need arrays, `regex` needs a string, and existence/null operators use the field path rather than the `value` field. Unsupported or malformed structures throw `IllegalArgumentException`.

## Owning components {#domain.rule-engine.components}
- `src/main/java/org/example/api/RuleEngineController.java` exposes the API.
- `src/main/java/org/example/api/dto/` contains the request/response contracts.
- `src/main/java/org/example/rules/RuleEngineService.java` implements the evaluator and rule semantics.
- `src/main/java/org/example/rules/Operator.java` defines the supported operator vocabulary.

## Main workflows {#domain.rule-engine.workflows}
1. A client posts a JSON payload to `/api/v1/rule-engine/evaluate`.
2. The controller validates the request and passes it to the service.
3. The service evaluates groups and conditions recursively.
4. The controller returns a JSON object with one boolean result field.

## Data and state {#domain.rule-engine.data}
The domain uses map-like input data and JSON rule trees. The visible implementation does not persist state or maintain workflow history; it performs evaluation within a single request.

## External integrations {#domain.rule-engine.integrations}
No external integrations or persistence adapters are visible in the inspected source tree. The repository exposes the capability as a self-contained HTTP service.

## Tests {#domain.rule-engine.tests}
The visible tests cover the controller and core evaluator semantics. They are a good starting point for preserving behavior when changing rule grammar or operator semantics.

## Change risks {#domain.rule-engine.risks}
Changing one operator can affect both validation and evaluation behavior. Changing path resolution can subtly alter existing rules. Changes to the public contract can require updates to the README as well as the tests.

## Unknowns {#domain.rule-engine.unknowns}
The repository does not define a production deployment model, an auth boundary, or a richer domain model beyond the evaluator. These are unknowns for future expansion rather than current implementation details.

# ANU-STORY — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

Business users need a reliable way to calculate interest amounts from a principal value, a rate, and a period so that the rule engine can support financial decision rules in a consistent way. The success measure is a clear, repeatable calculation path that can be validated with example inputs and produces the expected interest result.

## Proposed capability

Add an interest-calculation capability to the rule engine workflow so that a rule or request can evaluate interest-related scenarios without bespoke implementation work. The capability should be described as part of the product intake so the implementation team can design and build it against a shared understanding of the user need.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

The scope is limited to intake and planning for the interest-calculation feature; implementation details should be deferred until the requirements and design phases. Constraints include keeping the change aligned with the existing rule-engine API and avoiding assumptions about external billing or persistence systems. Stakeholders include the product owner, the engineering team, and any downstream users who will rely on the new calculation capability.

# ANU-STORY — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability enables financial rules to calculate simple interest from a principal value, an annual rate, and a period so that the rule engine can support interest-based decision rules in a consistent way. The measurable outcome is a deterministic interest amount that can be validated with example inputs. [ANU-STORY:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes a reusable interest-calculation path that accepts principal, rate, and period values, validates inputs, and returns a normalized interest result. It explicitly excludes integrations with external billing systems, persistence changes, or user-interface work. [ANU-STORY:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept principal, rate, and period values; MUST reject invalid or negative inputs with a clear validation error; MUST calculate simple interest using a documented formula; and MUST return a result that can be verified with example scenarios. [ANU-STORY:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing rule-engine expression and numeric handling paths. Risks include ambiguous rate semantics and inconsistent handling of period units. Open questions include whether the initial release should support only simple interest or also compound interest, and whether rate input should be expressed as a decimal or a percentage. [ANU-STORY:DE-001]

# ANU-STORY — Architecture and Design

## Context and constraints

The approved requirements define a reusable interest-calculation capability that accepts principal, rate, and period values, rejects invalid or negative input values, calculates simple interest deterministically, and produces a result that can be verified through example scenarios. The current repository is a minimal Spring Boot application with a placeholder entry point in Main and no existing interest domain model or validation layer. The design must stay within the existing Java/Spring Boot structure, avoid persistence and UI work, and remain additive to the current API surface.

## Proposed design

Implement the capability as a small domain service and an optional HTTP endpoint so the rule engine can evaluate interest scenarios without coupling the logic to the console entry point.

1. Add a domain-oriented service, `InterestCalculationService`, in the existing Java package structure. The service will own the calculation logic and validation rules for the initial release.
2. Define a request/response contract for the calculation flow:
   - `InterestRequest`: `principal`, `rate`, and `period`
   - `InterestResult`: `principal`, `rate`, `period`, `interest`, and `resultType`
3. Apply validation in the service layer before calculation:
   - `principal` must be non-negative
   - `rate` must be non-negative
   - `period` must be non-negative
   - invalid input values must return a clear validation error rather than a silent fallback
4. Use the simple-interest formula `interest = principal × rate × period` for the initial release. For clarity and consistency, the design assumes the input rate is expressed as a decimal fraction (for example, `0.05` for `5%`).
5. Expose the capability through a thin Spring MVC endpoint, such as `POST /interest/calculate`, backed by the service. This keeps the implementation testable and preserves compatibility with the existing Spring Boot web stack.
6. Keep the implementation isolated from persistence, background jobs, and UI concerns so it remains aligned with the approved scope.

The design also records two stable identifiers for the implementation follow-up:
- `SPEC-001` — Implement the interest calculation service, validation rules, and endpoint contract.
- `SPEC-002` — Add example-driven tests that verify valid calculations and invalid input handling.

## Security, observability, migration, and rollback

Security concerns are limited because the capability does not handle secrets, user accounts, or external integrations. The main controls are strict input validation, explicit error responses for invalid data, and no persistence or side effects in the calculation path. Observability can be added through structured request logs and response metadata without changing the public contract. Migration and rollback are low risk because the design is additive: the new endpoint and service can be introduced without changing existing routes or stored data. If issues are discovered after release, the endpoint can be disabled or reverted independently from the rest of the application.

## Alternatives and decisions

Alternative 1: Place the calculation logic directly in the existing `Main` class. This was rejected because it would couple the feature to the console entry point and make testing and reuse harder.

Alternative 2: Add a dedicated service plus a thin controller. This was selected because it keeps the logic domain-focused, testable, and aligned with the Spring Boot architecture already present in the repository.

Decision record:
- `AC-001` is satisfied by the service-level validation and calculation flow described above.
- The initial release will support simple interest only, with rate input expressed as a decimal fraction to avoid ambiguity.
- The implementation should remain additive and not introduce persistence or UI work.

# ANU-STORY — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability enables financial rules to calculate simple interest from a principal value, an annual rate, and a period so that the rule engine can support interest-based decision rules in a consistent way. The measurable outcome is a deterministic interest amount that can be validated with example inputs. [ANU-STORY:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes a reusable interest-calculation path that accepts principal, rate, and period values, validates inputs, and returns a normalized interest result. It explicitly excludes integrations with external billing systems, persistence changes, or user-interface work. [ANU-STORY:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept principal, rate, and period values; MUST reject invalid or negative inputs with a clear validation error; MUST calculate simple interest using a documented formula; and MUST return a result that can be verified with example scenarios. [ANU-STORY:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing rule-engine expression and numeric handling paths. Risks include ambiguous rate semantics and inconsistent handling of period units. Open questions include whether the initial release should support only simple interest or also compound interest, and whether rate input should be expressed as a decimal or a percentage. [ANU-STORY:DE-001]

# ANU-STORY — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability enables financial rules to calculate simple interest from a principal value, an annual rate, and a period so that the rule engine can support interest-based decision rules in a consistent way. The measurable outcome is a deterministic interest amount that can be validated with example inputs. [ANU-STORY:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes a reusable interest-calculation path that accepts principal, rate, and period values, validates inputs, and returns a normalized interest result. It explicitly excludes integrations with external billing systems, persistence changes, or user-interface work. [ANU-STORY:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept principal, rate, and period values; MUST reject invalid or negative inputs with a clear validation error; MUST calculate simple interest using a documented formula; and MUST return a result that can be verified with example scenarios. [ANU-STORY:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing rule-engine expression and numeric handling paths. Risks include ambiguous rate semantics and inconsistent handling of period units. Open questions include whether the initial release should support only simple interest or also compound interest, and whether rate input should be expressed as a decimal or a percentage. [ANU-STORY:DE-001]

# ANU-STORY — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

Business users need a reliable way to calculate interest amounts from a principal value, a rate, and a period so that the rule engine can support financial decision rules in a consistent way. The success measure is a clear, repeatable calculation path that can be validated with example inputs and produces the expected interest result.

## Proposed capability

Add an interest-calculation capability to the rule engine workflow so that a rule or request can evaluate interest-related scenarios without bespoke implementation work. The capability should be described as part of the product intake so the implementation team can design and build it against a shared understanding of the user need.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

The scope is limited to intake and planning for the interest-calculation feature; implementation details should be deferred until the requirements and design phases. Constraints include keeping the change aligned with the existing rule-engine API and avoiding assumptions about external billing or persistence systems. Stakeholders include the product owner, the engineering team, and any downstream users who will rely on the new calculation capability.

# ANU-STORY — Architecture and Design

## Context and constraints

The approved requirements define a reusable interest-calculation capability that accepts principal, rate, and period values, rejects invalid or negative input values, calculates simple interest deterministically, and produces a result that can be verified through example scenarios. The current repository is a minimal Spring Boot application with a placeholder entry point in Main and no existing interest domain model or validation layer. The design must stay within the existing Java/Spring Boot structure, avoid persistence and UI work, and remain additive to the current API surface.

## Proposed design

Implement the capability as a small domain service and an optional HTTP endpoint so the rule engine can evaluate interest scenarios without coupling the logic to the console entry point.

1. Add a domain-oriented service, `InterestCalculationService`, in the existing Java package structure. The service will own the calculation logic and validation rules for the initial release.
2. Define a request/response contract for the calculation flow:
   - `InterestRequest`: `principal`, `rate`, and `period`
   - `InterestResult`: `principal`, `rate`, `period`, `interest`, and `resultType`
3. Apply validation in the service layer before calculation:
   - `principal` must be non-negative
   - `rate` must be non-negative
   - `period` must be non-negative
   - invalid input values must return a clear validation error rather than a silent fallback
4. Use the simple-interest formula `interest = principal × rate × period` for the initial release. For clarity and consistency, the design assumes the input rate is expressed as a decimal fraction (for example, `0.05` for `5%`).
5. Expose the capability through a thin Spring MVC endpoint, such as `POST /interest/calculate`, backed by the service. This keeps the implementation testable and preserves compatibility with the existing Spring Boot web stack.
6. Keep the implementation isolated from persistence, background jobs, and UI concerns so it remains aligned with the approved scope.

The design also records two stable identifiers for the implementation follow-up:
- `SPEC-001` — Implement the interest calculation service, validation rules, and endpoint contract.
- `SPEC-002` — Add example-driven tests that verify valid calculations and invalid input handling.

## Security, observability, migration, and rollback

Security concerns are limited because the capability does not handle secrets, user accounts, or external integrations. The main controls are strict input validation, explicit error responses for invalid data, and no persistence or side effects in the calculation path. Observability can be added through structured request logs and response metadata without changing the public contract. Migration and rollback are low risk because the design is additive: the new endpoint and service can be introduced without changing existing routes or stored data. If issues are discovered after release, the endpoint can be disabled or reverted independently from the rest of the application.

## Alternatives and decisions

Alternative 1: Place the calculation logic directly in the existing `Main` class. This was rejected because it would couple the feature to the console entry point and make testing and reuse harder.

Alternative 2: Add a dedicated service plus a thin controller. This was selected because it keeps the logic domain-focused, testable, and aligned with the Spring Boot architecture already present in the repository.

Decision record:
- `AC-001` is satisfied by the service-level validation and calculation flow described above.
- The initial release will support simple interest only, with rate input expressed as a decimal fraction to avoid ambiguity.
- The implementation should remain additive and not introduce persistence or UI work.

# ANU-STORY — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The requested capability enables financial rules to calculate simple interest from a principal value, an annual rate, and a period so that the rule engine can support interest-based decision rules in a consistent way. The measurable outcome is a deterministic interest amount that can be validated with example inputs. [ANU-STORY:REQ-001]

## Scope

The implementation includes a reusable interest-calculation path that accepts principal, rate, and period values, validates inputs, and returns a normalized interest result. It explicitly excludes integrations with external billing systems, persistence changes, or user-interface work. [ANU-STORY:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

The completed behavior MUST accept principal, rate, and period values; MUST reject invalid or negative inputs with a clear validation error; MUST calculate simple interest using a documented formula; and MUST return a result that can be verified with example scenarios. [ANU-STORY:AC-001]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

Dependencies include the existing rule-engine expression and numeric handling paths. Risks include ambiguous rate semantics and inconsistent handling of period units. Open questions include whether the initial release should support only simple interest or also compound interest, and whether rate input should be expressed as a decimal or a percentage. [ANU-STORY:DE-001]

# ANU-STORY — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

Business users need a reliable way to calculate interest amounts from a principal value, a rate, and a period so that the rule engine can support financial decision rules in a consistent way. The success measure is a clear, repeatable calculation path that can be validated with example inputs and produces the expected interest result.

## Proposed capability

Add an interest-calculation capability to the rule engine workflow so that a rule or request can evaluate interest-related scenarios without bespoke implementation work. The capability should be described as part of the product intake so the implementation team can design and build it against a shared understanding of the user need.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

The scope is limited to intake and planning for the interest-calculation feature; implementation details should be deferred until the requirements and design phases. Constraints include keeping the change aligned with the existing rule-engine API and avoiding assumptions about external billing or persistence systems. Stakeholders include the product owner, the engineering team, and any downstream users who will rely on the new calculation capability.
